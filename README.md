<h1>PC verus Console: webscraping, aspect-based sentiment analysis, and topic modeling</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
This project aims to explore the common gaming debate between using a PC versus a Console. Using APIs, we scraped comments from popular subreddits and youtube videos on the subject. After cleaning and wrangling the data, we applied a common aspect-based sentiment model (deberta-v3-base-absa) to the comments. We then created a methodolgy to group comments into "pro console," "pro pc," and "neutral" comments. From there we used Top2Vec to model topics within each category.
