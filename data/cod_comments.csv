Jump shooting around a corner to kill someone waiting there on console almost always works because they literally cannot turn fast enough to react. If that same person waiting is on M+KB you cannot get the upper hand lol (same for the inverse if someone runs past you and doesn't see you).

Also, people with M+KB can generally use sub machine guns with iron sights from a distance and perform well. That's not happening on controller LOL! And snipers?

1. Who plays on PC? A tiny fragment of the population, certainly none of which are pros, considering the competitive scene is PS4 only.

2. Consider how well Atvi pays attention to and supports the PC player base. I think we all know the answer to this one.

3. The games used to be designed for PC then ported to consoles (COD4), now it’s the other way around.

But you seriously can't argue that you can aim well with a controller - almost all consoles games feature aim assist.

* The SBMM dosn't allow you to **""Play at your own pace and slowly get better overtime'** however the recent SBMM we have now? dosn't let you do that.. this is why SBMM needs to change

and before you say **""you want to change SBMM so you can pub stomp lobbies""**

uhh... yes... thats the whole point!..

i mean you tell me to ""Git gud"".. well even with the SBMM we have now.. guess what happens when a player actully gets WAY to good at the game? **THEY PUB STOMP THE LOBBY THEMSELVES!**

so... you either

**A:** Have SBMM be lowered so Casual/Average players can play at the own pace and slowly get better overtime to the point they can pub stomp lobbys

or

**B:** have SBMM be the same and even if the Casual/Average player improve slighty they will STILL gets pub stomped by players better then them

so... no matter how you look at it you STILL get pub stomped either way!

* you talk about skill? when recent CoDs today like MWII and MWIII have **PAY TO WIN BUNDLES!?** no to mention buying a bundle actully lowers SBMM for you so if you say things like ""skill issue"" but you actully use a Skin from a bundle with a skin on it... news flash... thats not your skill talking.... thats your money talking... and i find that pathetic...

That's not actually true, going of the latest Steam survey. The most common GPU is the 3060, which is a little bit better than a PS5 GPU. A few months ago, your statement was probably true

>Audio depends on your audio setup, but I'm gonna bet the $1000 sound system in my living room beats the $30 speakers you've got plugged into your gaming rig.

fnodss5,I think you forgot how difficult it’s is to aim with sticks on mid to long ranges. The aim assist doesn’t kick in if for example someone far away shoots from behind some cover. It’s almost impossible to shoot back accurately under fire in those situations. Aim Assist only helps in close quarters and accurately hip firing ist way easier with a mouse as it’s just point and klick. Also having the ability to turn of shadows and turn down graphics in general is a giant advantage that is definitely like cheating to players who don’t have the option to turn shadows etc off,None,14,2020-04-17 11:09:02,t3_g2pooq,g2pooq,The reality of the advantage that PC players have

Aiming with a mouse has its benefits as well as aiming with a thumbstick, they just require different skills to master that are mostly incompatible with one another.

I’m currently grinding through the transition to kb/m on pc and I’ve played controller on both pc and xbox.

fnnrcxs,"> Being able to generate frames higher than 60 without an appropriate  monitor is pointless and can actually lead to negative effects such as  screen tearing and input lag. 

Sorry but this is completely backwards. Even when you have a 60hz monitor, capping your framerate to a higher value will actually noticeably REDUCE input lag. This is because 99% of games do not have multithreaded input (which separates your mouse input from the framerate).

Anyway, I'm not sure why you made this post, you're not going to get any sympathy from console/controller users. The bottom line is: aim assist is an advantage at close ranges, but beyond that M+KB has a distinct advantage in addition to framerate, FOV (to an extent), and graphics options.",Necrophag1st,5,2020-04-17 04:58:23,t3_g2pooq,g2pooq,The reality of the advantage that PC players have

fnnrd4l,"I was gonna make a post covering the same thing, but this is spot on. The aim assist in this game is a bit insane. I have been an avid PC since I was a little kid, so about 15+ years. I've played every COD on PC, and I have even played competitive for COD4 and BO. Warzone is honestly the best BR I have played, even over Apex which I love. But, the main thing plaguing this game right now is the aim assist in crossplay. I love love love the idea of crossplay because it will definitely prolong the game on PC and console, but to make this work it needs balance. I am a chill person, I hardly complain. But when I do speak up, its about something that makes it hard for me to enjoy something every time I play.

Yes, the main argument I have been hearing is that there is balance because PC players can play at higher FPS and have higher FOV. But just like you said, definitely not every PC player plays at above 60hz. Also, the FOV slider can help, but it takes getting use to because it makes finding targets and hitting them at longer ranges a bit tougher.

However, the advantages that PC players do have in this game right now is being able to hit targets at longer range a bit easier. Sniping + ARs at long range definitely goes towards PC players, but it does take practice to be able to hit your shots. A lot of console players seem to think that they can just pick up kbm and immediately dominate because they see their favorite streamers doing it with ease. One comment I saw was ""PC players have an advantage because they can just click on peoples heads"". This is far from the truth. We have to account for recoil by actually moving and adjusting the mouse, and strafing. It is not as easy as it sounds.

The crazy thing is, I can immediately tell when console players kill me because they literally beam me with their gun in a straight line, without recoil. This makes it extremely unfair in medium to close range fights. Also, another big part of the game that this affects is the gulag. It is extremely close quarters and that of course goes in the favor of console players. Even more so because it is harder to aim with pistols on PC, but console players have the huge advantage of aim assist.

I've had a bunch of consoles over the years so I am pretty familiar with controllers, and I of course use controllers on PC for other things than FPS games. I went ahead and tried out the controller on warzone, and oh my god. The aim assist at times legit feels like aimbot. I don't think console players who have never played on kbm understand how much of a help aim assist is. Legit all I do is ADS and I snap onto my target, barely need to adjust.

And yes, I understand that there are people who use controllers have practiced and have become great with them, but it doesn't take away the fact that aim assist is still out of wack and needs to be tuned down a bit.

Also to the people that say, ""Oh well PC players should just shut up and use controller if it is so OP"". Honestly what a dumb thing to say. If there is something OP, the solution is not to tell everyone to use that OP thing. The solution is to balance that OP thing so everyone can just play the way they want.

This whole rant is just me wanting balance, so that the game can last a long time and be fun for both PC and console players. I've met a ton of cool console players that I love to play with and would hate to have to disable crossplay.",TrentIsDope,19,2020-04-17 04:58:28,t3_g2pooq,g2pooq,The reality of the advantage that PC players have

fno3m6y,"As someone who has also made the switch - albeit from PC to console  - I can safely say this: The KB&M version of me would  DESTROY the controller version of me. Maybe not everytime as I do agree that the advantage is somewhat marginal, but overall in terms of stats there is no comparison. Theres a reason I was rocking a 5+ KD on PC and am now a 2+ on console and that's because there are a bunch of minor advantages for KB&M. Drop shots, headshots at medium/long ranges, b-hopping, checking corners quickly, overall movement/awareness, recoil control, and sniping are all things that come naturally to a good PC player yet take years to master even just 1 on console. All of that adds up to one big advantage that may not present itself in every firefight but over the course of a year you damn well better believe your stats would be better on KB&M. This is all without even considering hardware, too. 

And for anyone wondering, I made the switch 13 years ago during MW1 and have never come close to a 3+ KD on console let alone a 5+. 

But sure, all things being equal, the console version of me might win some firefights  vs PC version of me assuming it was medium/close range (never at long range). And even if that kbm/console win ratio was only 5.1/4.9 (it's not and is probably closer to 7/3) it's the fact that's its uneven at all that annoys people.

Op says its easier to track targets etc but before i came to pc and starting playing at 144fps, 60fps was so smooth and very easy to track targets in. 60 fps is very smooth for people who dont play at 144fps all the time, playing at 60fps will only give a disadvantage in tracking for people who are used to playing at much higher framerates. The advantage 144 gives over 30 or 60 is that because of the more frames you can see targets a split second earlier when they peak. (Look to youtube for tests on this)

As for the whole kbm vs controller, using a controller in this game has a heavy aim assist making it so the average controller user has the advantage over the average kbm user.

Didn't changed, seeing enemies far away? Didn't changed, i just don't use 120 because Apex change the resolution of the game to avoid FPS drops, so it would make the game hella weird.

There's literally no disadvantage to use a higher FOV, is just getting used to deal with more information because technically speaking the aim don't change, hitboxes don't change, recoil don't change, the only thing that change is the perspective.

**Aiming:** something that isn't true **AT ALL** about pros on controllers is that they use controllers because of the aim assist... They run controllers because of 2 reasons:

1. They play on controller for years and they are the best on it, so relearning is straight up dumb.

2. Content; they built their ""fanbase"" around their way to play and what they represent, Aydan for example, he is better at KBM, why he don't play only on KBM? Simple: he represent the controller community, specially on Fortnite, and playing in a disadvantageous environment is what gives him money + his skill. The same can be said about pretty much every other controller content creators.

I have to agree with much of what you say but must also disagree with it too. Like yourself, I play on both, console and PC. I have been playing on PC since back when FPS games first came out (Yes I'm old). As for consoles it's pretty much the same thing. I started buying them every time a new one came out. 

As for this game. I know this is going to sound stupid, but if I had to play against myself. My console self would absolutely rape my PC playing self at any mid to long range fight. This all comes down to aim assist and nothing else. Like you mentioned, the aim assist in this game is pretty over powered. In a close range fight it would be exactly the opposite. This is only true because of how I have my game set up on the PC. I have everything in the game maxed out, including FoV and playing on an ROG Swift monitor at a constant 200+ FPS. Aim assist or not, I don't see how anyone on a console could accurately turn around and shoot me fast enough to kill me. I'm not syaing I don't die. . . a lot, because I do. I do however win the majority of any 1v1 close range fights that I engage in. 

My monitor is a 27"" set to  3840x2160. As you may well imagine, players far away from me are TINY and some times hard as shit to see. Which makes it really hard for me to park my little blue dot on a moving target long enough to kill them quickly. Given the same scenario on the console I have no issue because I play the game, like most people, on a 70""+ T.V.. It's never hard to see anyone no matter how far away they are and the aim assist helps me stay on target and get the kill. 

With all that said, I rate it like this:

**BR/Plunder**: Console > PC

**MP/Small maps**: PC > Console

For me though it's easy. If I plan on playing BR or Plunder. I will play on the console. If I just want to play some MP run&gun. I get on the PC.",D2Punchy,1,2020-06-10 09:25:32,t3_g2pooq,g2pooq,The reality of the advantage that PC players have

Here is the Activision support portal on the lack of Aim Assist on PC with controller that is being ignored. Making us assume that it’s by design. 

https://support.activision.com/community/s/question/0D54P00006mHiQoSAK/pc-controller-aim-assist-doesnt-work

FPS and FOV is not even an argument. It’s under our control to either purchase a console or pc. We can select the platform of our desire. I think we all knew that FPS and FOV sliders were available for pc and not for console before making the purchase. 

Beside that, FPS gives us more movement or smoothies. It does not determine the time and space. Ultimately, the server determines our time and space. So, whats on your screen can be interpreted differently on the server. 

Netcode or perhaps lag compensation is what it is “compensation.”

Will having a high tickrate be an advantage for those with better hardware? Because from what I’m reading COD tickrate is way lower than other games.",Difficult-Disk2733,1,2020-07-12 16:21:51,t3_g2pooq,g2pooq,The reality of the advantage that PC players have

g331pq5,"I play both. I have played controller for around 70 percent of my (quite considerable) gaming life. I built a pc, as I think every Gamer eventually would like to. Here's the thing.... Mouse and keyboard I decided to try after an infuriating afternoon on cod. Infuriating enough to break my controller (I know). I loved it. The movement is worth the price of admission alone. The fov, even if a console player had it, they probably wouldn't use it as over around 100 it gets severely difficult with aim assist, but with my keyboard and mouse I would go as far as to say it makes the game look and feel elegant. I found my aim required a little work, but then found I could set dps values and also most games had a myriad of options for setting all kinds of different sensitivities, not just the basic, movement speed that I used to get on controller, after a couple of days practice I didn't miss aim assist at all.
    Now I notice OP used a couple of streamers who use controllers as examples of how powerful controller is, and fair enough, but let's not forget that number means nothing compared to the thousands of streamers online who use mouse and keyboard.
    Sure, I use my controller from time to time because let's face it, if you haven't experienced aim assist on pc you are truly missing out. I actually don't know how you console guys (or how I used to on my ps4) manage to hit anyone. I had a round on my ps4 and couldn't hit anyone.

I play on xbox 1x with 1ms gaming MSI monitor 120hz 75% 9f my shooting I shoot first amd die first as watching every single kill cam shows enemy started shooting first anyway or same time but clearly using mouse as even shooting from the side or behind kb/m player can turn 180° in NO TIME and still kill you something you'll never ever be able to do on a controller.

Every essay is biased and that one favours pc players. Of course being able to see an opponent BEFORE he sees you coupled with the faster and sharper frame rates is a HUGE ADVANTAGE . What good is aim assist (which doesn't stick like gorilla glue like you all think it does) if you can't use it. Using a mouse and keyboard might take some getting used to, I agree, but having an entire hand just for movement is a lot more convenient then using a COMBINED 6 fingers (max)  to move AND shoot. Also, it's called ""hand and eye coordination"" not thumb and eye coordination. Shooting at range and sniping is definitely easier (more accurate) on mouse and keyboard in my opinion, then any aim assist.

But when he's dead and watching my screen, he can consistently call out guys I'm not seeing during my quick movement and head turning. He also uses controller which I'm sure a fair amount of PC gamers do. Especially those who made a recent switch from console. And as far as the Keyboard/mouse vs controller argument, I believe it's mostly about the player. For ppl who are experienced with KB/Mouse, I don't think there's a negative impact. For ppl with little experience, I'm sure there is. I appreciate your analysis/comparison but I do believe there was a little PC bias in there. I think you intentionally tried to down play the advantage for PC. To me, console vs pc is like a boxer moving up a weight class or two.

irvel9c,"Short version: implying huge advantages over console players as ‘marginal advantages’ down plays the fact you have a MASSIVE advantage lol 
Also, let’s not forget that as a PC Player you can have both Controller/Aim Assist and increased FOV. 
Not only can you have your cake and eat it, you can also say, “oh, but I can’t see a guy 200m out as clearly as a console player“ that sounds so rough, 
I couldn’t possibly imagine.. :(
(Sarcasm inbound) I’d definitely prefer to be able to see someone 12 light years away better than the guy with +10 FOV (the vision of an owl) and 220fps. Rather than being able to have the same peripheral vision as the guy who enters my building and rushes me. 
Recommendation: Remove FOV for PC Players to provide fair & balanced gameplay.

Another reasoning for this position is that we, PC players cannot disable crossplay, but you can (but you don\`t have to, cuz then .. no more players, no more easy kills, and no more fun).

The aimassist is idioticly easy aparently as you tell and I see in the killscene shots, so personally I\`m sick of this, killed by snap-on shots from all distance battles.

fnobv34,Why should we have to retrain 20 years of thumbskill because someone who mastered a superior input method has a small player pool?  Im missing where pc's small playerpool is console's problem.  With this game the camping bothers me more although it's hilarious to jump in the air and one deag hip fire a pc user and hear them through my mic aim assist is broken in this game.  I would rather know everyone in the lobby is using the same input method though for the sport of it tho.  To know these old thumbs still got it. Personally I feel movement is pc's greatest advantage having zero deadzone on a joystick to move with and zero input lag on that dancing. having an entirely separate arm and fingers for movement allows for much much better movement while still retaining perfect aim.  On a controller its all tight and connected so any overcompensation or pressure on one side affects the other and that affects the aim during the movement.  I typically have 120 ping so most killcams i watch where i fired twenty bullets when i watch them i never fired a single bullet its insane how bad this game is for that.,brianwantstohelp,-7,2020-04-17 10:35:50,t1_fnoaykh,g2pooq,The reality of the advantage that PC players have

I switched to PS4 pro to avoid cheater, i’ m usually top player in MP but i m so frustrated with AR in warzone on console ... close to mid range is ok, long range is not !

And let me tell you, it IS snapping onto players and locking them on, with a little bit of nudging from your player input on the joystick. 

Recoil reduction and tracking are inseparable. These 2 skills help you kill faster, and determine the better fps player. On PC these 2 skills have to be trained separately. On console aim assist gives you this huge skill boost by combining these 2 into one streamlined package which is aim assist.
