>The game itself is a huge mess due to a few issues inherent to the concept of MOBAs -
First of all, every match takes about 30-45 minutes on average to complete, while it is possible for a team to fall back to the point where victory will seem beyond reach in a few minutes. The feeling of being trapped in a game while being helpless fuels immense toxicity. 

>This is unique to MOBAs - in a first person shooter game  a player can always turn around a match with the proper application of skill, this is nearly impossible in League of Legends where an enemy can get a raw stat advantage by capitalizing on mistakes that he can abuse to beat the lane opponent over and over and widen the gap. Especially in higher ranks games tend to play out in this ""snowbally"" nature, which has an immense psychological effect on the team that falls behind.

Plus, you don't need multiple *TVs* persay, but you can be running a TV, and a few monitors. Or like in my case,  a projector is perfect for split screen, and throw in a monitor (or two) if need be.

With current gen, most of the few games that allow split screen, also allow it on PC.  
And controllers get automatically detected, especially since Steam added native PS4 controller support. You can even mix the controllers. Got friends that prefer the PS4 controller and some that prefer Xbox controller? Well, you can use them at the same time.  
In most cases, you have absolutely nothing more to do, than connect the controllers, wait for the game to detect them, and choose local MP mode. This is exactly as convenient as on consoles.  
Very few games require some extra setting up, like Borderlands 2, but in return there are also games where split screen is possible only on PC through mods. (Edit: Like GTA V, Skyrim, L4D2, and probably a lot more)",SabreSeb,4,2016-11-07 13:49:44,t1_d9pazvl,5bkhra,PC vs Console

1. Restart download (pause + continue)
This usually fixes the whole problem, especially when the download starts fast then suddenly slows down. There is a bug where after every minute passed, it adds another minute to the estimated download time. This can be fixed by pausing, then continuing the download.
2. Put PS4 in rest mode
If the problem can't be fixed by restarting the download, you should put it in rest mode, as the PS4 has nothing else to do than downloading and installing updates.
3. Restart PS4
If rest mode doesn't help, try restarting your PS4.
4. Check connection
If nothing of the above resolved the issue, check your internet connection on the PS4. If your download speed is low, it's probably bad reception over WiFi or an old/defective ethernet cable.

Party games are ones which are more 'party' orientated while Split-Screen is for more 'serious' gaming (fighting games will fall under Party games). These are all the games I currently own on Steam (minus Jack Box Party Pack). Theres more if you search for it on Steam.

Party Games:

**Obliteracers** (Can be played up to 16 people if they got mobile devices)

**Jackbox Party Pack series** (hilarious as well and go up to a fair bit of people depending on the game mode).

**Street Fighter series**

**BlazBlue series**

**Skullgirls**

**DiveKick**

**Lethal League**

**Castle Crashers** (drop in and out multi I think)

**Magicka**

**Battleblock Theatre**

**Mount Your Friends**

**Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed**

**SEGA Mega Drive & Genesis Classics (for certain titles like Sonic, Mortal Kombat and Street Fighter)**

**Metal Slug Series**

Split-Screen Games:

**Portal 2**

**Left 4 Dead 2**

**Rocket League**

**Serious Sam series (goes up to 4+ Serious Sam BFE I think)**


Theres probably more Im missing from my list, but the point is that PC has a pretty damn good party and split screen game selection.

This is because there are many different play styles and subclasses for each class where a specific weapon might work better than another. Yes, by default the stock weapons are balanced and made so that they are the best when the class is played in a traditional sense. But take for example the Demoknight subclass, by using the boots, a shield, and a melee weapon the demoman is no longer a wide-range area denial person but a skilled pick and play person. I personally would prefer a demoknight hybrid with the grenade launcher, tide turner, and claymor or eyelander where one is not neccisarily as useless to the team as a demoknight but can still charge unexpectedly and provide some use with pills. Although I would agree that possibly quite a few subclasses and play styles are pretty niché and are absolute rubbish (cough battlemedic cough) unless played almost perfectly

They’re typically much cheaper, and when a new one comes out you just buy it instead of having to do minor research to see what fits your PC and whether or not you need to replace multiple components to match or surpass the new consoles. Plus, I work on a PC. It’s nice to come home and play a game and not feel like I just moved from one desk to another.

kr519xq,When a console can play multiple consoles on it like a PC can (emulation) without jailbreaking then I'll consider consoles as worth the lower cost. Paying more for a pc is like paying more to play every retro console on your game box. Oh and the Nintendo Switch which is a current console. The ps5 is not backwards compatible yet my pc can emulate ps1-ps3. Ps4 is currently being worked on with pretty fast progress too. There's just so little that consoles get that I don't get at this point. Most exclusives suck and end up getting ported to pc if you just wait long enough. On top of that I get all of my games at a massive discount from steam sales. Consoles are notorious for not having sales anywhere close to as good as Steam. Pc costs more up front but is overall a long term investment that can continue to be upgraded.

There was an era of gaming, roughly 2007-2015, where the difference between the average gaming PC and a console was significant, performance wise, without being *too* excessive price-wise.

On top of that, the price for a PC that performs on par, or better, than the PS5 is only  $600-800, depending on your choice of prebuilt manufacturer which means PC gaming is at an all time low for the barrier to entry costs.

The trend is also going away from discs fast for consoles too. The PS5 has the entire disc reader as something optional.

PC games do have discs quite often as well, the demand and therefore supply just isn't that high since many PCs can't even do anything with a CD, DVD or Blu-ray.

Controller is better for games where precise control of movement is more critical, like platformers, fighting games, and non-shooter third person action games.  Personally, I feel it works well for couch party games and racing games as well.

M&K is better for games where precise camera control is more critical, like shooters.  It's also better for games that make use of cursors like RTS games and games with complex menus like CRPGs and simulators.

It's possible to get good at games with either option but there's a point where one will surpass the other in certain gameplay styles.

On top of that, I don’t need to pay to play online games anymore, so on top of sales, that’s an extra 80 dollars a year saved. In my specific example, my rig with a 2070 super and 3700x is likely to last me a minimum of 5 years and can individually swap out my cpu and gpu when they die, that will be $400 saved in ps plus and likely hundreds more in sales, though that’s hard to quantify. Specs wise it performs a bit better than a ps5 and series x, I also have the inherent benefits of a pc like a much larger library too. Basically what I’m saying is while I know some people want consoles for different reasons, price really isn’t an excuse, I have a system that performs better than a console and will likely end up saving me more money than if I decided to get a ps5.",jack-K-,1,2024-02-20 01:41:05,t1_kr84267,1aui3z0,"A response to that ""PC vs. console"" post."

kra1tx2,"No. Again, I'm saying that *frame rate standards* are catching up with the late 90s of PC gaming. That's not a technical matter, but an issue of what consumers are accustomed to and what they find acceptable. For years, in the 8- and 16-bit era, the standards for console gaming were full TV frame rate with occasional drops. Then, standards dropped significantly with the advent of 3D console games, eventually settling for way too long (IMO) on 30 FPS. That was the optimization target and anything beyond that was sacrificed for otherwise higher visual fidelity.

I won't hold it against anyone that they find 60 or 30 FPS acceptable. It's the need to somehow justify that standard with made-up factoids that is both sad and funny, prompting me to respond at all.

That's not accurate

A rx6650 xt performs similar or slightly better compared to the PS5 (in game), a rx 6700xt outperforms it quite a bit and costs about 350-450€

There are many gaming tests on youtube out there that show all similar results, e.g. [this one](https://youtu.be/JRvB72K546k?si=yXOOB83Wlo_WY_d6)

For me personally, pc's are a better overall deal, no online subscription, usually better performance even in mid range segment (if you build it at least one generation after console release), possibility to upgrade, option to use for creative work or office work, much cheaper games and the option for playing very old games, e.g. ps3 era

Versus PC where prices are lower and sales frequent, but hardware can be much more expensive.",notthegoatseguy,13,2023-08-26 01:18:43,t3_161galc,161galc,Console VS PC?
kg466fv,"Here is my personal opinion and experience because I am bored at work and I went down this road so hopefully this helps - 

I was a Playstation gamer through and through since OG PS1. I then fancied a change and bought an Xbox One on release for the exclusives, I think Titanfall was the main draw, and BF4 was the best game out at the time and the next gen upgrade really improved that game but my mate was sat next to me playing on a ps and me on my xbox in seperate lobbies so before I knew it I had bought a PS4 to play with my friends again.

This Gen I got a PS5 day one and bought an Xbox Series S as they were great for the money for game pass. Then I got the PC bug, I was playing a lot of Apex I had 250 wins in one month and hit Diamond 2 on ranked etc. I also made videos on my PS and was pretty good at the limited software. So I had PC on the brain and I was watching PC build videos a lot and eventually I sold the PS5 and decided to deisgn but not build a PC and got one done by a company for about £1800-1900 with all the parts I wanted. I bought a budget desk a decent monitor a chair and things were looking great, the PC was and still is awesome. My main game at the time was Apex Legends which I could run at my monitors max 144fps at 1440p and I was excited to play all the PC exclusives. Games ran and looked great and felt very smooth, buying games on sale was a bargain which is still one of the best pros for single player gaming and I loved the idea of learning K&M. Lots of games were going cross play I told myself so i will be all good, PC also has game pass...

After a while my mates even sold there PS5's because PC to PS crossplay wasnt great, our main issue was chat and generally less games had PC to PS crossplay than PC to Xbox crossplay. Also after buying £70 games on PS a few times the idea of game pass sold them. Things seamed perfect. Infact at this point my only regret was I could no longer play Ghost of Tsushima and I still cry about this every now and then today.

3 years later, the weight of the flaws outweighed the pros. Ultimately I stayed a controller player after so many years practise, I got good with K&M, and as easy as it was to beam someone across the map with a mouse I didn't like using keys for movement and it just wasn't as much of a relaxing time gaming on K&M having a few beers on chat with the boys. The cost to upgrade even just the graphics card alone next time around would be £800 and at this point I'm a Dad and am saving for a house and I know my gaming spending will take a big hit with bills etc.

THE BIG ONE. My friends were getting bored of playing online with me as our crossplay lobbies were far more difficult and had a lot more hackers. Also the on going battle of whats better aim assist controller or keyboard & mouse, well the worse bit about it really is having both in the same lobby doest work well as you have to play different to cater to them, its so much nicer on console knowing everyone is on the same hardware all with a controller. Even if aim asssit is better K&M can do long range a lot better. Playing alone in PC lobbies was even worse, when my friends were on I was at least in the Cross Play lobbies which helped balance it out a bit. Plaing solo in PC only lobbies is HELL, I had what felt like only pro's in my games as the avergae PC player is way better and there is a much smaller pool of players in general for matchmaking to choose from, thus less casuals and OMG the hackers. Also the GTA6 trailer dropped and for that I will need a console and the S may not cut it by then...

Anyway, we now play The Finals, great game and the PC lobbies were getting silly. I sold my S and bought a Series X which cost me £340 new - £100 I sold the S for and for a mere £240 my gaming experience overall is better than the £1000's on the PC.

It took me a few days to completely forget and not notice the frame rate change and mere minutes to release the massively improved level of fun having console only lobbies. Also jumping on for some NFS or any random game pass game is quick and easy on console especially with quick resume meaning more short games here and there while trying to juggle work and being a Dad. So, take it from me most gamers will be much happier on console but the Ultimate one answer is get what means you can play with your friends the easiest if you like muliplayer and if money is of any concern at all fon't even think about PC.

If you are looking for a better gaming experience my first question would be are you playing on a TV, if yes get a monitor, a desk and a chair this is the real benfit of my whole experience in my opinion.

I have listed some points next to each option in regards my opinion below:

Playstation 5 - If your main friends play PS get this. Exclusives are great but its £70 a time or wait for discount. Buy The Ghost of Tsushima, what a damn good game. 

Xbox Series S - If you are on a budget and just a casual gamer, this thing is incredible with game pass, if your on old gen due to money get this £100-150 second hand, great bit of kit.

PC - If you have money to burn and you just want the best graphics and frame rate for single player gaming there is nothing better but it comes at a cost, not just money wise but convience gets hit hard. If you play multiplayer games mostly and your friends are not on PC good luck. The main benfit is of couse a PC is not just for games. Also I do miss being able to type in my games.

Xbox Series X, my choice for the overall win in regards, services, budget, performance but perhaps not if your friends are on PS.

I hope this helps anyone having the internal debate, if you really think you are a top tier gamer multiplayer wise then feel free to ignore all and go get that PC :-) or if you completely play solo and have money but otherwsie console I belive is the answer is most cases.",Tomenski,9,2024-01-03 11:58:53,t3_161galc,161galc,Console VS PC?

jxt43rc,"They're just different and what fits you better depends on your own wants and needs. A console will cost less for the same gaming performance, and will be a much simpler device to manage. For the most part, minus some basic maintenance (mostly dusting), a console will just work.

A PC will cost more, and is more complicated to use and manage, but it also has the potential for far better performance (it all comes down to money of course) and much more versatility beyond just gaming. You can also upgrade a PC overtime, while a console's upgrades are usually limited to storage.

It's not a simple one is better than the other without knowing your specific wants and needs. This is similar to Switch vs other consoles (or even PC). Switch will have the least performance out of everything else, but it throws in the portability variable.

kwacn2g,"Thing is, with PC gaming you have to adapt to the constant evolution of hardware and specifications. What I mean is a PC you buy now even if you spend $1,500 to 3k 5 years down the road you're going to be looking to buy upgrade components or a flat out new one all together because it's going to become inefficient and obsolete and you'll notice that game requirements and game specification recommendations are only going to go up and up, so while you used to be able to game with 8 GB of RAM and 4 GB vram, now you can't even hardly find any new modern games that don't require at least 16 GB of RAM and 8 GB of VRAM and that's the bare minimum. Basically with PCs in order to keep up with what's current and modern you have to keep spending money and either upgrading the computer you got until you can't upgraded any further and turn around and buy another one, or go with consoles, which remain the same throughout their entire lifespan, and game developers have no choice but to meet the requirements for said console or choose not to release on that console. Look at the lifespan of a typical gaming console for instance. Usually it can be 8 to 10 years nowadays, and I guarantee you as long as they are making games for that console the console will play those games, as its designed to do so. I guarantee you a new computer even 5 years down the road will most likely need to have it's GPU, RAM and possibly CPU/power supply upgraded, costing almost as much If not more than the computer itself cost to begin with. PC gaming is more expensive because of that. 


TL:DR... Gaming on PC is always going to be more expensive and more tedious because of the evolution of computer hardware and developers catering to increasing hardware specs. Consoles stay the same throughout their entire lifespan, so no money spent on upgrading anything to keep up with the latest game demands.",mwhart2024,1,2024-03-24 02:33:43,t3_161galc,161galc,Console VS PC?

If I am ever going to do PC gaming, it will be whenever I get a Steam Deck OLED. If a game can't play on that, I don't consider the game worthy of my time and money. Plus, I hate the bulk and price of PC gaming in general, and I'd rather be comfortably portable (or at least able to move more freely).

But if your just looking to play games just for fun and don’t have any interest in like streaming or just playing games every once in a while go for console. PCs are expensive though so I recommend going for a mid tir pc because there not super bad but there not top tir unless your a huge streamer making money off of it go for a high tir. But don’t spend a whole bunch of money on a top tir PC when you don’t really need it. If your on a budget tho go for console cause you get your moneys worth in my opinion compared to a pc.

I’ve enjoyed my time with PC but I started to get gamer fatigue and lose interest so I stopped playing games. My flatmate put his Xbox in the lounge and I’d play when he wasn’t using it and it brought back the spark for me. Gaming is just way more fun when you can chill on a couch and load up a game. PC is too much admin imo.

I think I’ll keep my PC but get an Xbox because I just don’t enjoy Pc gaming nearly as much as console gaming.",beansff,1,2024-07-12 00:22:13,t1_kg466fv,161galc,Console VS PC?

Which is one reason why long run pc is cheaper. 

Another reason, as stated before, is games are much cheaper on pc. Like ridiculously cheaper. I can get a game that is $80 on playstation for $7 on the pc. That isn't a typo. Mainly because of people selling codes they got for free. But it's through legitimate sites.

kr0asx4,"I know this is probably a little late but i just wanted to add in my experience as a pc gamer of 8+ years only playing multiplayer games 

I have had no such experience with hackers and they are almost non existent in anything but the top ranks of any competitive game

The cross platform point is moot at this point in time, not every game is cross platform between pc and consoles but the big multiplayer games that most people would even want to play with their friends are (apex, fortnite, cod). Besides most xbox and playstation games arent even cross platform with eachother anyway. Not to mention that pc is much easier to meet new friends thanks to platforms like discord, text chat within games etc 

There are also more multiplayer games in general on pc, beta tests will prefer to launch on pc and you dont have to a pay subscription to play online.

This isn't related to multiplayer but the original poster severely overestimated the cost requirements for pc. 1000 british pounds is about 1300 usd which is a high end pc. It'll get you a experience far beyond anything on console but for most people 650$ will get you a great experience too. You could even go lower than that but below that, trying to match the price-performance of a console will take some bargain hunting..

l529ax1,"Are there some ""PS5 only titles""? I bought PS5 and I had PS4 for 7/8 years. I spend a lot of money on games and PS Plus. Borderlands 3 on PS4 is very slow and laggy. On PS5 I played Elden Ring, Newest Horizon and God of War. This console has no games.

I bought in November 2023 Minisforum hx77g. I stopped using ps5, which is collecting only dust. I have so many games on epic games store, steam and other platforms I don't even have a time to play them all. I'm still buing some games for few EURO/USD because they are much cheaper than console games. I never liked to play fresh new games, because they are so expensive. It's better to be patient and buy few years after release date.

I bought PS5 for 770 USD with GOW Ragnarok bundle.  
845 USD for Miniforum PC with 6600m and 7735HS CPU.  
That pc is 100 % better than console. Its use less power, is much smaller, more quiet and I can find somebody to play a games much easier. I don't need to pay 76 USD every year to play multiplayer.  
Ratchet & Clank Rift Apart is cheaper 4 usd on PC (in my country) and looks really good enough.

Why I bought PC? I had nothing to play on PS5. Even if I have over 300 games from PS Plus.

IMO PS5 with subscription and games price is more expensive than PC but it's depends from country/region.

In my country I can buy PS5 with 5 years of PS Plus for 960 USD.  For the same money I can have better PC.",dawinbi,2,2024-05-21 19:09:51,t1_kr3ukiy,161galc,Console VS PC?

A Cronus which just reduces recoil but you have to do edits mid game and even then has input lag is not comparable to hard aimbot on PC which is what a lot of people are running and not to mention wall hacks on PC which aren’t on console. If you want to compare this to a Cronus you have no clue what you’re talking about. I have used both PC cheats which as long as you don’t use headshots easy anti cheat doesn’t detect these (same goes for wall hacks). I have also used Cronus which is a really poor man’s recoil control device. The only reason I have used both was so I could comment on how they work.

But Steam has multiple sales throughout the year, which are way better than most sales for consoles.

l6cu2ni,"If you're fine with playing with performances close to a console, why would you buy a 3080 in the first place?

Console experience is stable for the whole duration of the gen (mostly) because games are optimized for it.
 However, PC experience is tailored to the last gen, maybe last two gens of components, then it degrades fast.

Basically, if you don't replace your 3080, your experience will become worse as games get better looking, since games not tailored for your rig = you either need to have games worse looking than before, or you need to sacrifice some fps. Either way, you either accept it, or you put some more money on the table every 4 years

On console, games are tailored for your rig, so they slowly but surely get better looking while still maintaining a stable framerate.
You'll get the same thing as PC when the next gen comes out, the difference being that it will happen 7 years after, and each gen cost you way less money

And no, you can't build a PC for a 1000 bucks that does better than a ps5. Even with used parts, that would be hard, and the comparison wouldn't make any sense anyway since it wouldn't compete with a used ps5 anyway

lj1981z,"well maybe if you weren't ignoring the part of my comment where i make the actual POINT, you would understand what I mean. I never said games on steam are more expensive than disc games. I said disc games can be bought used, and more importantly, SOLD afterwards, aka getting ALL your money back.

it doesn't matter if you buy the game the day it releases or 5 months after. sure, if you buy it close to release, you aren't gonna get it much cheaper by buying used, at most maybe $10-15 cheaper. but guess what, after you finished the game, you can sell it, and most games don't take  that long to beat, that the price on used games market will have gone down so much from when you bought it. maybe in this case you'll end up losing a bit of money but still you'll only have payed $10 at most to play the game instead of $70 if you had gotten it on pc

and if the game is more than a few months old, then it's even easier, since the prices for used will at that point have stabilized to somewhere between $30 - $50 depending on the game. you can just buy it, play it, and then are pretty much guaranteed to sell it for at least as much as you bought it for. it's THAT easy. i have had a ps5 since 2021 and i have spent barely any money on games so far, and i've played lots. consoles legit have a free games hack and nobody talks about it for some reason.

I mean sure, it depends on what you need to use it for. indeed, most people can do all the stuff pcs do and consoles don't.. on their phone. so phone + console would be enough. if you are a student, a programmer a whatever who needs pc for other things, then a laptop would surely be superior. even if including costs. i mean, if you want to build a pc that matches a ps5 in performance, only the gpu (3070, 4060 ti, 4070) would cost almost as much as a whole ps5.

and also if you are someone who needs a computer for things.. you probably already have one by the time you are thinking of buying a gaming machine. nobody is out there trying to choose between buying a gaming pc and a console, and going like - yeah.. the pc would be the better option, because it allows me to do the thing i need to do for work/ browse the internet. and the console doesn't. lmao.  you know?",_snowdrop_,1,2024-08-20 13:00:44,t1_lixz35p,161galc,Console VS PC?

Or are you saying consoles only overtake a 3070 and after like 5 years?

Console games just run at lower and lower settings over the course of the generation to run ""stable"" whereas on pc you have to manually lower those settings yourself. People somehow perceive this as the console running everything the same for 7 years straight. Ridiculous.

Are settings lowered as time passes on console ? Yes. Are games still optimized to ensure you get the best experience possible out of it year after year for up to 7 years? Yes

On PC, the first answer is yes, but the second answer is no. The drivers are not made with old components in mind, and games are not optimized for those either.

Games are optimized with the last gen in mind on console or pc alike, but a gen on console lasts longer, which means a console will give you the experience you paid for longer, too.




As already mentioned, building a pc for twice the price 4 years later makes no sense comparison wise. Just checked benchmarks for those parts on some games, its not even better than the ps5, same perf in games or a bit better at best in some games, way worse if you decide to use ray tracing, and for the reasons mentioned above, it won't be the focus of optimization for as long as the ps5. Games in 2 years will still be optimized with the ps5 in mind, but the 6750XT will start becoming an afterthought (it already kind of is today) 
Soon, when the ps5 Pro comes out, it will blow away your parts list for cheaper. I could literally resell my ps5 I bought 4 years ago and buy ps5 Pro for the same total price, so 4 years with the same performances as this PC + an upgrade for the same price you pay to only get this PC now

A desk and a chair are not optional if you want to equal the experience of an average sofa, a cheap monitor won't ever have the same visuals as an average tv even for the same price since the main use isnt the same, and a cheap kbm will in no way equal a dualsense in general comfort of playing (even for competitive playing it depends on the type of game / role you play in)

And don't get me wrong, I do also play on PC, it has its advantages, but a lot of PC players who would be better off straight up switching to console keep clinging to PC gaming because of stupid feeling of superiority that has been outdated for more than 10 years now, console players are not on ps3 anymore",NoPseudo79,2,2024-05-31 19:32:53,t1_l6dzmhg,161galc,Console VS PC?

How can it be ""the best experience possible"" while having to continually lower the settings? You can have the best experience possible on pc except you just have to lower the settings yourself, and you get to choose what you lower/limit and by how much.

You keep mocking him for repeating himself, but he probably wouldn't if you weren't twisting his words half the time.  
What he is saying is pretty straight forward: on console you buy hardware that will be tended for by developpers for a longer time, which is true.  
The difference in gaming experience between the start and the end of a generation of console is generaly slim, games usually tend to look better even though the hardware gets older.  
On PC it is less the case, sure you can lower the graphics to run the games, but the games won't be optimized to make the most out of your dated hardware

  
""How can it be ""the best experience possible"" while having to continually lower the settings? You can have the best experience possible on pc except you just have to lower the settings yourself, and you get to choose what you lower/limit and by how much""

Not that simple. Most games lately have been really cpu demanding for example. Good luck trying to get a stable 60 fps on those games, usually you'll get a bottleneck forbidding you to get it (and we're talking absolute 60 fps here, which is really common on ps5). Alan Wake 2 is a good example for example, or TLOUP1

""Show me these benchmarks with max settings that you're comparing to PS5's low-medium. And you can also sell used parts when you upgrade.""

He won't show you those benchmark because that would be a dumb comparison. If you want to see how a pc holds up to a PS5, you compare it using the same settings the PS5 uses for quality mode and performance mode, and see if it manages to do the same or better.  
With the configuration you gave as an example, quality mode on PS5 literally stomps PC (especially if there's ray tracing, since AMD doesn't fare well with it), and on performance mode it will vary from game to game as far as I've seen, usually a bit worse or a bit better, but nothing major.  
As for selling used parts, you can usually see consoles getting sold for 70% of their launch price, sometimes even more, even after a new one comes out. It is harder to sell used pc parts because it is more risky for buyers (cards worn out from extensive use or after a big OC, ...)

""And this price comparison didn't even factor in the game price difference. Before you tell me I'm wrong, check gg.deals""

People love to use the game price difference as an argument, but not only do they forget to calculate how much games you'd need to buy to actually compensate the hardware price (way more than most gamers usually buy), they forget something even more important: physical games still exist on console.  
If you account for the physical stores, then console gaming is way less of a monopoly than pc gaming (at least in Europe). To make a quick list:  
-You can buy games as low as half the price in some supermarkets if you pay the game day one.  
-You can usually find the games around half the price a few days after the game came out when people start reselling their games  
-I'm gonna insist on this, but you can actually resell the game. Combined with the first point I raised, you can literally play for free by buying day one, finishing the game and then reselling for the same price you bought it  
-Usually games on amazon are on sales for pretty much their lifetime, dropping to around the steam price with 5€ give or take  
-You can literally rent the games. Think gamepass, but with all the games that have a physical edition included since day one. That costs like 25€ a month, so if you finish 2 games/month that just came out, that becomes really worth it really fast. Then you buy games you liked a year after when you can find them for less than 10 bucks

Combine all of the above, and the prices on [gg.deals](http://gg.deals) start looking very shabby (and without fucking developpers by using grey markets)

""How are a desk & chair needed to match a sofa? A sofa is needed to match a sofa, and you can use your sofa for the pc, aswell as the tv""

That's why SOME games are poorly optimised, and are considered exceptions, not the rule (although the number is increasing as devs get shittier). And calling the difference in performance (of PS5 games over time) slim is just silly.

How could one replicate those ""modes"" on PC? If they did then that would further show how much better the pc hardware is, because my point was that native 4K would have a close enough framerate to PS5's upscaled 4K in these benchmarks.

""You can rent games"" yeh no shit, that's all you'd be doing if you kept reselling physical copies. You can't call that the same thing. And half price on release? Really?

And even that would be a stretch if you care about the quality of the graphics. To be certain, you'd have to have triple 1080s, which Nvidia deliberately disallows without a key of some sort. And even then, many games don't support 3-way SLI. On average, you'd see about 120 fps with 2-way SLI with ultra settings. I suppose that if you drop down to high graphics or such, then it wouldn't be too much of a problem though.

You'll get buttery smooth gameplay from any game, just remember to set the individual program settings for each game. 


The way it was explained to me is that your fps fluctuates up and down so often that it creates stuttering and screen tearing even if your card isn't struggling all that much. Locking the fps to your screens refresh rate stops that fluctuation and does what gsync and free sync do without a new monitor. 

There's an interview with a famous overclocker or someone like that that explains how and why it works. It's pretty recent but I cannot seem to find it.

hme1hqr,"Ah never ending debate.

It depends on who you are as a gamer.

You play multi player fps? PC. M+kb is far superior than controllers.

You play MMOs or Dota? PC obviously. They are not in Consoles for the most part. 

You play arcade racing or sports game like Fifa? Console. Controllers are far better then M+KB. Especially because of joystick.

You want a hassle free experience for the best performance ? Console. It is on developers to optimize the game for the hardware. 

You want to tweak the shit out of game and enjoy mods? PC 

You like immersive single player games? Console, especially Playstation. And the PS5 dual sense controller is no gimmick. It's amazing. 

You don't want a year to wait for the next AAA game? Console. Many games usually launch (Rockstar games, Deathloop recently) a year later in PC. 

You see where I'm going with it. In 2021, the graphics difference is not much. Sure technically PCs can destroy consoles but the reality is most games are console ports and usually much more optimized and bug free on consoles. 

The main reason to chose one over another is because of what games and what kind of experience you prefer. 

In an ideal world, PC plus PS5 is the best combo",GhoshProtocol,9,2021-11-28 11:21:12,t3_r41zj0,r41zj0,PC vs Console

hme2zye,"—edit some typos—- First off I have a PC, PS5, XBSX and a switch. PC will always be better (I’ll explain I’m not shilling) no questions asked. Graphically far superior, utility, customisation, choice, emulation and all sorts. BUT modern consoles are closing that gap, yes they still fall behind however a lot of those things don’t matter to a lot of people. On the cost front PCs in the past could easily beat the consoles of the time without spending “stupid” money, but nowadays the improvements in console power has come a hell of a long way and for the vast majority of people it’s more than enough. Yes 120fps is better than 60, but let’s be honest, most people out there running 4K TVs are capped at 60, so the new generation of consoles can more than hold there own for a fraction of the price. Just checked my local marketplace for an RTX3070, not top end of the new line but not the bottom either, cheapest I could see was £800. That’s just your GPU, you then need all the other bits to go with it, then you need to put it all together and set it up (surprisingly high amount of people don’t want to do this themselves), then you need all of your peripherals. A console you literally buy it and plug it in, done. Got an update? Just hit accept, done. Sure they may have faults but so do PCs, sure when a PC part dies you just replace that one part and a console is more difficult in that sense, but it’s not exactly common. Consoles are just “easy to use” and get the job done. That’s what most people want. And like I said earlier, they’ve come a long way are pretty up there in the performance aspect now. They’re more highly adopted so people can just jump on with there friends, sure cross play has closed that gap a bit now but not everything supports it. So the main point, yes PC is better, if you seriously care about fidelity and full control and all that jazz. But if you just want to play some games and have a bit of fun with your friends, then consoles are great now",oiMiKeyvx,2,2021-11-28 11:40:58,t3_r41zj0,r41zj0,PC vs Console

I don't know if he's genuinely frustrated and wants to switch, or he just wants to change and feels he needs to justify it to his audience, but it just rubs me the wrong way.

2. His lack of a spine sometimes. I think he lets his audience push him around a bit too much. I know his viewers drop when he plays something other than R6, but that shouldn't stop him from playing something he wants to play. He's also vague when chat asks him questions that involve him giving an opinion.

Especially with  high RoF headshot machines like the Scorpion. Acog defenders are obviously a different story, as they are 1 speed and that is their purpose basically. But even for them, high accuracy across long distances should require bursting.

Most attackers shouldn't be able to spray accurately across long distances either. Being accurate at a long distance should require burst or tap firing. Defenders have the advantage of just waiting and holding angles tho, so attacker guns should of course be stronger, just like they currently are.

They make their money off the whales, less than 1% of the player base in most cases, who will spend thousands of dollars in a couple years on micro transactions. The whales are people who are gonna play destiny as long as their something too. So make the infusion system expensive as hell and they will play more before running out of things to do. More play time = more micro transactions.


This works on the whales on two levels.The first because they are more likely to see someone with some emote or something that they don't have and they'll buy it. And the second is the more time the whales spend, the more invested they become and the more they can justify spending just five for dollars for that emote. And since they've removed buying emotes directly like in D1 its a chance system, so 5 becomes 10 then 15 and before you know it you've spent thousands of dollars in a year for emotes. 


Microtransactions unfortunately are going to be around until they cease to be profitable, which isn't ever going to happen. There will always be whales and companies who want to milk those whales. And as long they build content to do so people will like us will be annoyed with the system. Also mark my words you think Destiny is bad, Anthem will easily be an order of magnitude worst.

A bit of bloom can help differentiate rifles and smgs from snipers too, but, if you are on target at a reasonable range, you should never just miss.

I will try and find some reference to it as it's been a while since I've seen it, but I've experienced this myself when I'll have a few great games and notice that when I start to slip again and have some bad games I'm finding it much more difficult to aim because it doesn't have the same weighting and drag as before.

It's just another thing for people to moan about and claim misinformation about. I've always thought aim assist doesn't give you the advantage people say it does.

I've played both with a controller on PC, and mouse and keyboard probably equally. The only reason the controller gets used is so I can play from bed. My performance on my mouse games are always the  same if not better with close range weapons, but then it's not even close when I pull out the marksman rifles. Mouse completely dominates with precision weapons to such and extreme that I think you can give the kid hip firing with an SMG on a controller a pass cuz his controller rotates for him 🙄.

Competitive is likewise usually played on these    maps that are designed to funnel people in close.

I get what you're saying but just outright claiming controller is superior completely discredits all the advantages that mnk has in its favor. Yes the controller player will likely be more accurate overall with current map design, but you're still glossing over how much easier it is to use the sidemounted Lazer on mouse, how much easier it is to control recoil on mouse, and just how much faster you're gonna click a headshot if you're playing bolt action.

Non of those people mentioned how aim assist completely turns off if the target is slightly covered by a bush, tree leaves, railings, etc. The last video basically shows how aim assist works with no comparison with other games.

But what baffles me the most is how neither xclusive ace, the guy in your 2nd link, or OP in this post had FPS as a factor.

That's the problem. He doesn't have a dog in the fight in this context. 99% of players are not shroud or even close. Most players are average at both kb/M and controller. I'm pretty average myself and since cod has become crossplay ill have good and bad matches. Primarily against console players.

Also, I don't take this conversation seriously at all, ever. I played BO3 on pc with a controller since I wasn't comfortable with kb/M with the movement system. I was on controller and probably everyone else was on kb/M yet I held my own most matches. Some of my highest kill games were on BO3.

hedtacd,"I wouldn't consider one instance representative of the whole, especially if your friend mostly did FIFA and was never very into shooters. When I made the switch to PC (in early 2020) the very first thing I did was load up MW2019 on a friend's account. It took me a few hours to get used to WASD movement which I would consider entirely fair for someone who'd been using a controller all his life up till then. But once I got over the fumbling fingers and my muscle memory started to develop, I noticed my aim was significantly better on mouse, and indeed if I could find a decent camping spot where I didn't have to move and consciously think about it, my stationary aim was better even before I got used to the movement controls. A good wall mount spot on PC was way more effective for me on PC than it ever was on console. Once I was really used to it and didn't have to consciously think about my movement anymore, my general performance was much better on PC than console. 

In my case, I haven't used aim assist in CoD or any other game that allows me to turn it off for nearly a decade so maybe for me going from free aiming with a controller to mouse precision was an easier leap, because the actual mechanical element involved is more similar than having aim assist do all the work of tracking moving targets and such. When you have aim assist it's not really something you ever have to think too much about, but when you remove it you have to retrain your brain to do the extra work aim assist *was* doing for you. Even so, if you're used to free aim on controller and you're actively into shooters I bet you'll find a lot of people will actually have better free aim on KBM, provided a good few hours to acclimate to WASD movement. Though I will note that in single player titles, for example Killing Floor 2, my performance is about equal as far as headshots and such on both input methods, which leads me to think the true key factor is in predictability, as obviously enemy players in PVP will move in more wild and unexpected ways than single player bot enemies in a zombie horde shooter.",MedicMuffin,1,2021-09-26 19:26:44,t1_he8m2ge,puzbxi,[COD] Made something for the recent pc vs console discourse.

It's why I mostly stick to sniping these days, at least in CoD. Truthfully I'm hoping one day more developers will have enough balls to not offer aim assist at all and just give us a good sensitivity suite. I just can't consider a game competitively viable if it has aim assist because it removes a fundamental part of aiming skill. Though of course that game would need input based matchmaking at the very least since KBM vs free aim controller is about as unfair as aim assist vs KBM free aim.

dgo5sh4,"I should preface this with the fact that I am a PC gamer, majorly, although I do own a PS4. Linux, specifically. But I think I'm being pretty objective here.

1. Consistency. Game developers can make a game that will work for 100% of their target audience. There's no driver incompatibility, there's no weird bugs that only work on certain types of hardware. All of the hardware is the same and you can count on that.

2. Ease of setup. Take it out of a box, plug it in to the TV. Done. No real technical expertise is needed. You don't need to know how to install a graphics driver, you don't need to know how to keep malware off your machine. This is a huge motivator for both sides of the age spectrum: extremely young and extremely old (which the latter isn't a very large audience for gaming, granted). This is also a huge motivator for some 20-40somethings that maybe only have used PCs for work, if at all. I know some people my age (mid-30s) that their only technology usage is their smart phone. If they wanted to get into gaming, they'd most likely want to go for a console because of this point.

3. Exclusivity. This is a ""fake"" point, since it exists on both sides of the fence. There's PC games that aren't on console and there's console games that aren't on PC.

For starters, it's much less common on consoles, especially in markets that the industry really cares about (e.g. North America, Japan, and Europe). Also, consoles (and arcade systems) have a long history of strong anti-piracy practices, from unique formats to hardware encryption (the Sega Saturn's crypto-chip was only broken in the last couple years), while PCs have ""don't copy that floppy,"" ridiculous instruction manual gimmicks, and more recently, filesharing and DRM that's either inconvenient, anti-consumer, or broken by hackers within days of release.

dgofm1m,"I've been a console player way longer than I have as a PC player (but i do adore both!)

1.  **Consoles don't have hardware compatibility issues**. On PC, if you don't have a certain graphic card? Tough, you're not reaching that minimum spec / maximum spec. You could argue that consoles ""have"" the same issue (e.g, Xbox One games won't work on Xbox 360) but it's very easy to notice based on the game cover itself. Even if you look at the back of any PC game's case, the specs will throw off anyone who isn't up-to-date with hardware.

2. **Security**, when it comes to online gaming, you can bet your bottom dollar that console manufacturers (Sony, Microsoft & Nintendo) will block your console if they even detect that you've messed around with their hardware. PC on the other hand, with the infinite amount of hardware out there, it's impossible to do the same. 

3. **Customization**, This is what really sets the tone between consoles & PCs. On PC, you can customize everything in a game (even if the mod tools don't exist!). Hate your character? Turn him into a her or vice versa (or just import a whole different character!) Want more gameplay? Check out the mods available! On Consoles, you're limited to what Game Developers want you to have through Downloadable Content (DLC). Just to prove you can imrpove the replayability of a game, look at [Doom's mods](http://www.moddb.com/games/doom/mods). That's a game that came out in *1993* and 24 years later still gets content, way longer than ID Software could keep up. Whereas consoles get ~1 year of content and then gets forgotten.

4. **Portability** Let's be honest, to move your PC anywhere is a hassle *but* if you have a laptop then it's gaming on the go! Imagine waiting at your terminal in the airport with an hour to kill. With a console, you could not do that simply as you'd need a monitor and 2 plugs to power both on.

Requiring less knowledge/time/intelligence is advantage for people who don't understand PCs, and are not willing to invest the time to learn, or just aren't smart enough to use them.

As for the cost argument it is very dependent on your ability, it is very possible to build PC that runs at the same graphical level as console for cheaper initial price, but if you don't know what are you doing you might buy extremely expensive PC that is quite underwhelming performance-wise.

dgo6k8v,"1. Initial cost. It's extremely hard to build a PC for under $250 that's as good as a console. Also, that assumes you know how to build a PC. If you don't, it's going to be much more expensive.

2. Polish. There are a lot of bugs, or glitches in PC games that just aren't there in consoles. At least in my experience.

3. DRM. PCs tend to have much more DRM because it's much easier to pirate a PC game than a console one.

4. Lifespan. You can buy an original. Xbox or PlayStation and it'll last you a very long time until you have to buy a new console. And they last even longer than that, you just can't get new games on them. One of the few advantages of a closed platform.

5. Cheating. This is a pretty small one, but there is pretty much no cheating on console. It's more common on PC, but still rare if the game has good anti cheat measures.

6. Physical discs. They exist for PCs, but it's a lot harder to get one, and a lot of PCs don't even have disc drives nowadays.",MarduRusher,8,2017-04-24 04:37:35,t3_676e39,676e39,What are some points in the PC vs Console argument in favor of the latter?
dgo5ccy,"**Bugs**: There are large categories of bugs you can run into on a ~~console~~ PC that you don't have to worry about on a ~~PC~~ console.  In general, the odds of a game just working the first time you run in are higher on a console - sometimes I'll have to spend time downloading fixes or tweaking settings before I can play a game on PC, but that almost never happens on console.

It's also more common for a PC itself to develop issues than consoles, in my experience.

**Life Span**: The time between console generations varies, but is often quite long.  For example, it was 7 years between the release of the PS3 and PS4, and 8 years between the XBox 360 and XBox One.  That means that if you bought a PS3 on launch day, as long as it didn't break, you'd be able to reliably play the latest PS3 games without worrying about cranking down any settings or getting lower framerates.

Meanwhile, for a gaming PC, even with top-end parts, usually within 4 or 5 years you'll either need to turn down the settings or experience framerate drops on the latest AAA releases.  Granted, sometimes you'll still be getting graphics and framerates as good as you would get on the consoles anyway, and you can always upgrade just the graphics card, but overall there's sort of more security in a console purchase.  If I buy a new console, I know there will still be new AAA games released that are designed to run on that console until the next generation one comes out, while with a PC there will probably be games designed for better hardware than what I have sooner than that.

**Controls:** Most of the time, you can easily play games with a controller on PC nowadays, so preferring to use a controller isn't really a reason to pick consoles over PC, but there are some exceptions.

First, multiplatform games with no controller support on PC do exist.  Personally, I know of Diablo 3 and the Path of Exile in this category (the XBox version of Path of Exile isn't out yet, but it'll have changed game mechanics to support a controller, and they won't be adding controller support to the PC version).  So if someone prefers playing those games with a controller, then the console version is better for them.

Also, in some multiplayer genres, most notably first-person-shooters, a keyboard and mouse has a significant advantage over a controller.  In those games, someone using a controller to play online on PC will be at a significant disadvantage.  So if you enjoy playing online first-person-shooters using a controller, then you should play them on a console.

There's also just alternative controllers.  Back when motion controls were popular, consoles were generally the better option for playing motion-control games.  Right now most console games are just using traditional controllers, so this isn't a big factor, but it's possible it'll pop up again.

**Portability:** This is exclusive to the Switch (and other portable consoles, of course, but I assume you're talking specifically about home consoles since the pros and cons of purely portable consoles are obvious), but if someone values being able to take their games on the go, that's a huge advantage for the Switch over a PC.  And there's always the possibility that Sony and Microsoft decide to release portable versions of their consoles in the future if the Switch's success continues, which could turn portability into a general console trait.

Even besides the Switch, an XBox One or PS4 is still smaller and lighter than most gaming desktops.  I could easily bring one of my consoles over to a friend's house and plug it into their TV (and I've done so before), while hauling my desktop over to someone else's house and setting it up there would be a huge pain.  Gaming laptops are a thing, but they generally give worse performance relative to the price than desktops (especially if you're building your own desktop), are harder to upgrade, and can be more prone to overheating, so while that addresses the portability downside it exacerbates other downsides.

**Local Multiplayer**: Local multiplayer's declining in availability in general, but it's always been more available on console than PC and I think that's still the case.  If I want to play a game with some friends in the same room, a console will usually give some good split screen options while a PC game is more likely to require setting up a LAN party.  And on top of the extra hassle to set things up, a LAN party requires every person to have their own machine and copy of the game.",Quazifuji,9,2017-04-24 04:00:45,t3_676e39,676e39,What are some points in the PC vs Console argument in favor of the latter?

dgo9nca,"A lot of these arguments I'm seeing are just the typical console side of the console vs PC argument. 

The only concrete winning side to consoles are use case, price, ease of use, and familiar ecosystems. If you're someone who likes couch gaming consoles are tailored for that and don't require any fiddling or stream boxes to make work well under a TV. Price is obvious. You get less power but you spend less money. PC gaming isn't nearly as expensive as people try to act and there are clear ways to reduce prices, but they usually require effort. You can't just go and buy a gaming PC at your local Gamestop. This ties into ease of use. You have maybe two products in a brand to choose from, but once you make your purchase there's not a lot you need to do to get right into using the system. Ease of use is the be all end all of consumer technology and consoles are pretty easy to understand. Then there's the ecosystem that you're used to. Maybe you're coming off the PS3 and wondering whether you should buy a PS4 or a gaming PC. One has the sequels to games you like, can use physical media that can be bought at the Gamestop next to your workplace, and possibly has a UI and digital marketplace that functions like what you know already. PC has stuff you need to learn. As we all know from people finding iOS to be a backwards nightmare of an OS after using Android, people don't like change when it comes to consumer technology. If you're already a PC gamer you're probably not going to want to go to consoles and vice versa. 

So it's different for every person whether consoles are better for them. If you value open platforms or the highest of high end performance you know where to go. If you are on a budget or just really like Naughty Dog games you already know where you want to game. The kid who still primarily plays games on his DS Lite because DS games are cheap and his brother had a collection has his own use case. All that matters is what's right for the individual.

dgo5kb3,"Speaking strictly as a console gamer I don't think there is a compelling reason for using consoles over pcs for gaming. However, when it comes to why some people still prefer console gaming; well, I think it's as simple as it just works. In the same way that someone may choose a mac over a pc. Sure, it may be you are getting ""less for more"", but there is no knowledge of hardware needed, no assembly is required, no real research is necessary, and everything you buy specifically for that device will, at a minimum level, work. Of course there are a number of other smaller and perhaps more specific things that lead people to specific platforms, but I think ease of use is a major part of it. One other thing I think adds to this is that while you can build a pc that is more powerful for less money the disparity in pricing may not be wide enough to convince people to go that route. Admittedly, consoles start out considerably overpriced for what they are offering in terms of graphical fidelity, but prices are usually quick to drop and only continue to do so over time (except in rare cases). For example, when the Xbox one came out in 2013 you could probably build a more powerful pc for $300/400 but that difference of $100/200 may not be worth it to some consumers who don't want to research and assemble how to build a cost efficient pc.

dgpdef7,"From a development standpoint, Consoles were easier to work with - they're extremely uniform, so you can produce to a single standard and expect little deviation from it (though some new things, like the PS4 Pro, throw that previous certainty into more doubt).

From a consumer standpoint, consoles are extremely simple - they're a dedicated unit which does one thing, with minimal futzing required.

Consoles also require a smaller capital investment from customers - if you want to play new games on a computer, you're probably investing ~$1000, versus $400-500 for a new console. While in the long run, a lot of games are ultimately cheaper on the PC, this is slowly changing with increases in the consoles' online stores.

Consoles also have particular exclusives (which is also true of the PC); if you are looking for a particular game, sometimes you'll have to pick a particular platform (PC or one of the consoles) to get it at all.

dgqltou,"I play on console 95% of the time and this is what it boils down to. 

1. Comfort and familiarity. I've had many consoles throughout the years, and I'm just used to having a controller in my hands and a TV in front of me. It took me a while to get used to TF2 on PC, and even when I finally got a hang of the controls, I didn't feel 100% comfortable and couldn't enjoy myself properly. You could give me a top of the range PC and a PS4, and I'd still choose the PS4. Familiarity is comfortable.

2. Cost. €400 console vs a €1,000~ PC. A PC is too rich for my blood.

3. Multiplayer. I have many family members nearby that I'm close with. Often enough, we'd come together and play some multiplayer game together. While only 4 could play at one given time, the others can still sit in the room and we can all watch and discuss what's happening. If this was PC, we'd all be sitting around the dining room table on our laptops. It's just easier to include people with console I find.

4. Simplicity. I like the vanilla versions of games. I have TF2 on console and I still play it every now and then. I also played the PC version, and there's so much in it, it's just overcomplicated for me. On the more technical side, console is just so simple technically compared to PC. You take it out of the box, connect it to the TV and play. With a PC, there's graphics cards and mods and all this. 

5. Friends and family. For the most part, my friends and family are all on console, so that way we can all share games, discuss and play together. 

6. Games. This can go either way, but exclusive games. I prefer the console exclusive games over PC. 

Someday, if I devoted more time to PC, I might end up playing it more often, but that's a someday, not a today.

I hate troubleshooting - I've had a lot of bad luck playing PC games and I've spent literally hundreds of hours troubleshooting various games over the last 25(ish) years of my life and while it's gotten better/easier in that time it's still consistently frustrating.

I spent an hour or so making sure all my drivers are up to date and trying some simple fix actions. Then I spend 30 minutes driving to Gamestop, buying a used copy of the game for console for 10 dollars, and returning home where the game just works.

I would never attempt to diminish the positive aspects of PC gaming and I generally keep a decent PC around for exclusives but I hate dealing with it unless it's unavoidable.

Getting a PC that is cheaper than a console for the same or similar specs (or better specs for the same cost) is really easy **IF** you know what you are doing or are willing to learn. Console gamers love to point out that ""PC's are more expensive"" but they are only ever thinking of walking into a store, pointing at what you want and paying sticker price. If you do that then yes, PCs are more expensive than consoles. On the other hand, if you know a bit about hardware or are willing to put in the effort to research and learn about it the cost difference disappears or even errs in favour of PC. The massive advantage that consoles have over PC is that they have no required knowledge or time investment you can do what console gamers think PC gamers do (walk into a store and buy something off the shelf).

dgojbxo,"Here are a few reasons why I do not currently own a gaming PC. I intend to get one at some point, but right now it's not practical, because:

1. **Space** - I haven't seen many people mentioning this one, but I live in London which is one of the most densely populated cities in the country and as such there is a very severe housing crisis whereby people pay an enormous amount for a comparatively small apartment. I live in a small one-bedroom flat with my girlfriend - there is simply not enough space for me to have a big desktop PC in our already cluttered living room. I know many other people who live in fairly small rooms in shared flats, so equally there is not enough space to have a full gaming rig, whereas a console slots neatly underneath a TV. 

2. **Price** - People often say that the cost of PC gaming balances out because the games themselves are cheaper, but I'm not so sure. I can go down to CeX and get a PS4 for £165. A laptop at that price will have basic functionality and could run a lot of older games, but it wouldn't be able to play The Witcher 3, for example. On another note, the games themselves on consoles have resale value - I can get a AAA game for £40, say, finish it and trade it back in for £20-30 depending on the demand for the game. When you take this into account, it dramatically lowers the effective cost of games for consoles. 

3. **Convenience** - Consoles have become less good at this in recent years but still for the most part I'm able to turn on my PS4 and be playing a game within less than a minute. In my experience of PC gaming, because you have to use the Windows OS, there's a bunch of things that can often get between you and gaming - windows updates, etc. 

4. **User Interface** - You touch on this above, and really it's not much of a big deal such that it leads me to prefer consoles over PCs, but the UI on the PS4 is very easy to use and lets me switch between playing Rocket League with a friend to watching a show on Netflix. PCs in my experience are a little bit more fiddly on this front, but I'll agree it's not really a big deal.

5. **The Console Itself** - Bloodborne, Nioh, Uncharted 4 - just three games off the top of my head that I can only get on PS4, and the first of which is one of my favourite games of all time (never played the other two). With a console like the Nintendo Switch, furthermore, you have a gaming experience which isn't replicated elsewhere - if I had a Switch, I'd be able to take Breath of the Wild and Mario Kart 8 - two really excellent AAA games - out with me wherever I go. 

6. **Sunk Costs** - This is probably the most tenuous point and people are free to call bullshit on it if they like, but in my experience people who spend a lot of money on building a huge gaming rig tend to spend a similarly huge amount of money making the rig even better. I have a friend who spent something like £1,500 on a very powerful gaming rig, played Shadows of Mordor and noticed that the framerate would occasionally drop to 50fps. There was no way he was allowing this in the big, expensive gaming rig he'd just invested in, so he spent another £400 on a second graphics card just because of a small framerate drop in certain built-up areas. Performance on consoles may be worse than on PCs, but there's no opportunity for me to spend inordinate amounts of money on things to tweak the performance by a relatively small amount. With PCs, on the other hand, the sky is the limit and [as this link argues](https://youarenotsosmart.com/2011/03/25/the-sunk-cost-fallacy/) people who feel they have invested a lot of time and money into buying and building something become *more* likely to spend a lot of time and money in making it better, because otherwise they'll feel like all the previous investment was a waste. It's something I recognised myself doing back when I had a gaming rig, and I'm glad that for the most part consoles don't have these absurdly expensive potential upgrades that you can buy for them.

Games require huge day 1 Patches just to even run, and the consoles have limited memory to hold such things. Aside from Nintendo, the physical media of a console is a glorified install disc. The online services for consoles are inexplicably hamstrung to the point where installs take forever and a day and even then the game isn't guaranteed to work. 

Consoles have a low up front cost but a PC costs less over time and has other functions besides just playing games even if you get one specially designed for that purpose.

dgodjvu,"I'm a console gamer. The primary reasons are money and frustration.

I don't have much money for a computer. I hated trying out PC games only to find out they didn't work for me. Sorry, this game runs at 2FPS because your graphics card is old or the wrong type. This one lags like crazy because of your GPU. And this one is too much for your CPU, or you don't have enough RAM. Then, finally getting the money to upgrade one thing, and finding out I need to also buy a better power supply to use it.

It was awful trying again and again to get a game working only to find out it simply would not run at a playable speed. It was painful to go through the options one by one and turn the graphics down lower and lower, trying to figure out if having grass on the ground was worth playing at 9FPS. I'd rather have a decent-looking game at a decent framerate than a beautiful game I have to turn into monotone mud via graphics options in order to play.

With consoles, you buy it and it works. If you buy a PS3, *every single PS3 game ever* will work on your console. Though they may not be getting incredible FPS, they'll at least get playable FPS. And you always know it'll work, there's no guessing or hoping. No begging the store to let you return a game because you opened it, installed it, and realized it was too much for your computer to handle. (That last one is much relieved by Steam refunds existing, but it's still a problem if you want to own physical copies of your games.)

tl;dr: I stick mainly to consoles because you always know the game will run. No fiddling with options for an hour only to discover that your computer just can't handle it.",ShiraCheshire,0,2017-04-24 09:36:48,t3_676e39,676e39,What are some points in the PC vs Console argument in favor of the latter?
dgon9eg,"I live in a somewhat rural area where most people have internet data caps and low download speeds.  Having to purchase and download digital games eats up data and can be very inconvenient.  A lot of people just want to go to the store to buy a game.  Steam is very convenient for a lot of people, but it can be an obstacle if you have bad internet.

The biggest factor in favor for consoles is the low initial investment and ease of set up.  I can go to a local store, pick up a xbox one or ps4 bundle for about $250.00.  I can bring it home and after an hour or so of set up, I'm good to go.  I prefer PC gaming, but my graphics card alone was close to the same price as my xbox one s.  

Consoles are easier for young kids as well.  I know a lot of parents that have kids between the ages of 5-10.  If a parent is going to buy a video game platform for their young child, they just want to go to the store and pick something up.  They do not want to have to build a PC that their child might not be able to use or might break.  


A huge benefit of consoles is used games.  I often give away copies of games to friends and family after I am done with them, but I can't do this on PC.  I can also lend games to friends on console without interfering or limiting my access to my other games.  

Couch co-op is a lot easier with consoles as well.  I enjoy having friends over to have a few beers and play Gears of War, Halo, or Borderlands split screen.

Dark Souls games control just fine on my PC.  I assume you're talking about keyboard and mouse but you can use gamepads on PC, so that's not a legitimate thing that consoles do better.  I play a ton of games on my gamepad.  For example, I'm playing Assassin's Creed Unity and Hollow Knight right now and I'm using my 360 controller on both games.

dgo9xfc,"Advantages of console:

1. Much lower barrier to entry: The initial console is cheaper than a gaming PC and you can buy one on any high Street. No specialist knowledge is required and there are no pitfalls to be avoided in buying a console.

2. Standardisation has many advantages: Console games ""just work"". There is no fiddling around with settings trying to get games to work. 

3. Console gaming is inherently more social. Consoles are designed to be played in a living room that is shared with other people. PC games are designed to be played on a one person machine. Also your friends are more likely to have a console than a gaming PC.

4. The use of physical media allows for games to be shared and  facilitates second hand sales. It also means that your investment in a library of console games holds its value better than the money you spend on non transferable licenses to play PC games.  These advantages are disappearing though as more console games are being sold digitally and as more games are being locked to accounts.


5. The competitive life span of a console is much longer than that of a gaming PC. If you buy a console on release you can be pretty confident you will still be able to play the latest releases in 5 years time.

It isn't really a fake point so much as it is a variable one. If you have a particular game you want to play, and it is exclusive to a platform, then you have to use that platform in most cases.

What platform it is is variable. Though these days, most things which aren't exclusive to a single console are on PC as well sooner or later.

But like, if you want to play the Uncharted games, you need a PS4. If you want to play Halo or Destiny, you have to get an XBox One. If you want to play Nintendo games, you need a Nintendo.

PC exclusives are made for the PC platform and not the PC brand. Like you said before there is not parity between all PCs. PC exclusives are similar to come thing like Destiny, not like Uncharted or Halo. Console specific exclusives are made to support a platform. Look at was Sony has been putting out in the last 2 years, and even Nintendo with Zelda. With Sony's first party exclusives, we are seeing an extremely high level of polish and quality in these games.Bloodborn, Uncharted 4, The Last of Us, and Horizon are all great games that Sony hasn't rushed and has ensures polish because they are supporting the Sony brand. We don't see this on PC, and I don't think it would be possible in PC. Not to say PC doesn't have great exclusives, the exclusives just don't have the brand support and consistency that a lot of console exclusives have. There are exceptions to this idea though. Halo 5 and Gears 4 are games that weren't nevisarily bad(gears being pretty good from what I've heard), but they aren't considered masterpieces or games or the year.

That's kind of a moot point, and you even pointed it out yourself. Most console games run at a locked 30 FPS which is actually really easy for even several years outdated gaming computers to hit for most games with ease on identical graphics settings to consoles. It's not a high benchmark, it's just that dedicated PC gamers frequently aim for much high framerates like 60 fps and 120-144 fps since they can build their rigs to hit those. People who don't want to or don't care to can just run with the console standard 30 FPS on most games quite easily. 

I ran a GTX 660 from 2012 until just a few months ago and was perfectly capable of getting 30 fps or even higher on modern games with it, and for a non graphically demanding game like Overwatch I was getting about 110 average by lowering my settings. I did get around to upgrading it to a newer GTX 1060 since I wanted to get more use out of the 144hz monitor (ohmigod it's so fucking smooth) I got for Christmas, but for someone with the same standards of framerate as a console, they'd be totally fine just leaving it as is for a few more years.

dgpf9zi,">Life Span: The time between console generations varies, but is often quite long. For example, it was 7 years between the release of the PS3 and PS4, and 8 years between the XBox 360 and XBox One. That means that if you bought a PS3 on launch day, as long as it didn't break, you'd be able to reliably play the latest PS3 games without worrying about cranking down any settings or getting lower framerates.

> Meanwhile, for a gaming PC, even with top-end parts, usually within 4 or 5 years you'll either need to turn down the settings or experience framerate drops on the latest AAA releases. Granted, sometimes you'll still be getting graphics and framerates as good as you would get on the consoles anyway, and you can always upgrade just the graphics card, but overall there's sort of more security in a console purchase. If I buy a new console, I know there will still be new AAA games released that are designed to run on that console until the next generation one comes out, while with a PC there will probably be games designed for better hardware than what I have sooner than that.

The problem with this argument is that it assumes that consoles don't fail, but they often do. And indeed, the first console out in a generation is the most likely to fail.

The fifth generation had the Sega Saturn, the 3DO, and the Atari Jaguar fail. The sixth generation of consoles had the Dreamcast fail. The eigth (current) generation had the Wii U fail.

That's a *lot* of failures. We've had a major console from one of the big three fail about once per generation on average for the last four generations. The seventh generation was really the only generation in which there wasn't a failed console.

And that's ignoring technical issues, like the many XBox 360s which got the RROD. Estimates suggest somewhere between a quarter and a third of first year XBox 360s had that problem, and some failed later on down the road.

You can't actually rely on the lifespan of consoles; it has been pretty unpredictable historically.

It should also be noted that different console generations have lasted different lengths of time:

First generation: 1972
Second generation: 1976
Third generation: 1983
Fourth generation: 1987
Fifth generation: 1993 (this is debatable - the 3DO and the Jaguar both came out in 1993, but both failed. The PSOne came out in 1994, and the N64 didn't hit until 1996!)
Sixth generation: 1998 (though one might argue this was really 1999, as the Dreamcast died quickly - the PS2 was the first console to last)
Seventh generation: 2005
Eighth generation: 2012 (and again, the first console to hit that generation - the Wii U - ended up dying)
Ninth generation: 2016 (Switch)

It isn't terribly reliable.

For reference, I got my old gaming PC in 2009, and built my new one in 2016, so it lasted me 7 years - as long as the seventh generation of consoles lasted.

I don't find that PCs have to be upgraded any more often than consoles these days, though that wasn't true back in the 1990s - but that was because PCs were much further ahead of consoles back then.

I bought into this argument a while ago and bought a console so i could enjoy more interpersonal play and to my dissapointment (should have researched more thoroughly i guess) there are more local coop games for pc than there is for console. Few exceptions exist with artificial split screen removal which you can usually reenable. The only exclusive AAA local coop game that springs to mind is Diablo 3.

In so far as AAA publishers focusing on console, this is also wrong. You get the occasional AAA console exclusive but for every one consoles get pcs get multiple.

1. This is one point I think could be a problem, but only if you are using keyboard and mouse. Otherwise it becomes an almost non issue, as PCs can still fit tidily in many places consoles are put.

2. The time and effort it takes you to trade in that game and the fact that if you don't trade it in fast it won't get much back, makes console game trading not efficient. Maybe for teens who don't have a job and have time it is useful, but for working adults/students in SS, time is money.

3. The last time I was interrupted on PC was this month actually, for a Windows update. No big, I reschedules it for 11:00pm in 10 seconds. A year before that most windows updates didn't even bother me at all and happened automatically when shutting down. And consoles have lost their ""plug n play"" with updates too. And the PS4s download time.... Screw me man.

4. Alt F4, CTRL ALT DELETE. Do anything faster than the time it takes for you to press the ""home"" button on a consoles and go to the main UI.

5. PC has exclusives too. MANY more. More than consoles combined, and I dont wanna buy each consoles just to play a game. Remember people saying Zeldas actual cost for some was over 400$ it was true in a way.

> Trying to argue that consoles are better

Nobody is saying that, certainly not OP. He/she is asking for valid points in favor of consoles in this discussion. Pricing is definitely a pro for consoles, if you ignore game prices (Not everybody wants a 100+ steam library every year).

Your game setup sounds like you have at least a $800+ build. Telling someone who is fairly neutral (or new) in gaming that your build is a better choice than a $250 console is quite a dumb argument. A lot of people don't want to spend that kind of money on gaming. I find the whole discussion weird: Consoles are clearly there for people who just want to play games once a while for a low entry price. I can't think of a decent pc build for <$400.",Argon91,1,2017-04-24 13:32:16,t1_dgo8qgq,676e39,What are some points in the PC vs Console argument in favor of the latter?
dgoaxab,"I can't even begin to describe all that's wrong with almost every single of those statements...

1. On /r/PCMR and in hundreds other places there are build that cost $400-500 that destroy consoles in terms of performance. So it's a questionable point at best...

2. Get your head out of early 90s' arse. Games on PC just work, unless you have some kind of Frankenstein's Monster type of PC. Or a Mac. Also on consoles they don't ""just work"" - they ""just function"" with no way of making them ""work"". Stop trying to make setting sound like something people have issue with.

3. Ri-ight, and that's the reason console games have been dropping split screen and other forms of single-unit multiplayer for the last 5-10 years - cause there are inherently more social? And unless they are children or Apple fanboys - they are far more likely to have PC than a console, since, you know, it's a PC - it's used for everything and almost every household has one. Sure, it might not be able to play newest games even on medium settings, but then again, neither can consoles.

4. Yes, but majority of people on PC also buy games way cheaper because of sales and generally better pricing across the board. And if you make an argument about buying preused cheap games on console - then your ""holds its value"" argument goes out of the window as those games you've bought second hand on a cheap will hold zero value when you try to sell them. Also as you have mentioned outdated physical media is finally being phased out, and when it comes to digital, consoles have all ""flaws"" of the digital games on PC, only without refunds, good sales and with shitty servers that make you download games for days on high speed connection.

5. This is the typical peasant bullshit that indicates that person saying it has no idea how electronics work. Ok, explain to me, how the bloody fuck does PC performance degrade over the years yet console one stay the same? It fucking doesn't. Your GAMING PC will play newest release in 5 years just as well if not better than a console. The only difference is that on PC you will have to set settings to lowest and on console they will be LOCKED at lowest.

6. No they don't. If you exclude the sabotage by publisher to ensure the ""parity"" between the PC and inferior consoles *cough* WATCH_DOGS *cough* and cases like Arkham Knight when ports were delegated to amateurs or were rushed - PC generally works better at launch, simply because of the fact that you can tinker with settings and because there are some nice people *cough* Durante *cough* who within days if not hours fix issues that shithead developers left in game occasionally or intentionally.",NekoiNemo,2,2017-04-24 07:20:18,t1_dgo9xfc,676e39,What are some points in the PC vs Console argument in favor of the latter?

dgr0rg4,"> You won't have a graphical setting that you have to tweak over and over based on how the game ends up performing, since the game's hardware was known and thus could be extensively tested and optimized for that.

I don't think that's actually a positive.

The problem is that a lot of console games end up targeting 30FPS, which would qualify as the bare minimum of playable frame rates. This is totally fine, if the consoles could actually reliably maintain that, but they can't. E.g [Mass Effect: Andromeda](https://youtu.be/DJG9d6zcwLk?t=285). 

When you drop form 30 FPS to 25, the difference is very noticeable and unpleasant, every time that happens I wish I could go to some settings menu and tweak shit in order to maintain a steady 30 FPS. On the other hand, if you'd target 60 FPS, then dropping down to even 40's doesn't feel as bad as the 30 to 25 transition.

Which is actually why we're starting to see more and more games adopt some sort of settings or different graphics modes even on consoles so that you could maintain a steady frame rate if you want to. I've seen many many users demand these kinds of options for years now because steady frame rates are always better than variable ones.",Aozi,5,2017-04-25 22:55:32,t1_dgoiium,676e39,What are some points in the PC vs Console argument in favor of the latter?

So you either don't get to play them because you don't want to buy a console, or you don't get to play them because they simply don't exist in a world that is free from exclusives.

These aren't comparable to PC exclusives that are exclusive for absolutely arbitrary reasons, and it's mainly eSports and MMO games that are built upon a platform of their own on which they want to milk you with (cosmetic or non-cosmetic) lootboxes/microtransactions and/or want to push themselves as a (e)Sport and make money that way - and of course the slew of Early-Access trash that wouldn't see the time of day on any other platform.

And if you wanna argue that we all would be better off without consoles, stop and think about how that would affect the whole gaming business and especially the mass-appeal and thus the higher sale numbers that are the sole reason big AAA games are even a worthy investment for capitalistic companies.

dgo5x6l,"It really depends on the genres you play and the environment you're in if PC or consoles will have better local multiplayer experience.  

Some genres where consoles excel here are sports games (Fifa, Madden, NBA, NHL, etc.), party games (Just Dance, Mario Party, Jackbox, etc.), and fighting games (Smash Bros., Street Fighter, Killer Instinct, etc.).  

Even if all of these games were available on PC and even if they all had local multiplayer, the experience of sitting around a TV is often more enjoyable than sitting around a computer screen, which is usually in a smaller office room with less furniture.

As for AAA developers focusing more on consoles, I think this again depends on your preferred genre.  No Nintendo games come out on PC for example, so if that's your preferred style than a console just makes more sense. 

Other companies like FROM soft will make PC ports that are clearly not as polished as their console versions and require users to mod or patch before they are a good experience  (to be fair, FROM has gotten better about this in recent years).

Gaming in general covers a huge spectrum of genres and styles these days, some of which are definitely better on PC and some of which are better on consoles.  In the end, whatever platform has the games and play styles you enjoy the most should be the one you go with.

dgo6q03,"Ok, I was trying to help a kid with homework, but let me break this down for you.

PCs have wayyy more games than consoles, so of course there are more ""interpersonal play"" games for PCs.  But the *interpersonal play experience* is far superior on a big screen TV sitting on the couch than with 2 people huddled around a keyboard and a desk.  PCs are ergonomically designed for one person, no matter how many coop games there are.  And ""coop games"" are kind of rare in general.  Most local multiplayer games are ""versus"" because most gamers want to have some light trash-talking competition with their friends rather than build virtual snowmen together or whatever.  PCs are great at multiplayer, but very awkwardly designed for *local* multiplayer and it's not really debatable.

As for AAA, most huge titles are across all platforms now.  It wasn't that way 10 years ago, but business is big enough and investments in development have made it worthwhile to do this.  But still, the cutting edge tech is going into the console versions.  It has always been this way (except for networking code, and VR now) because consoles have always been about selling the dream of the future and to do that they need to show something you can't get on your old console or on your PC.",lubujackson,1,2017-04-24 04:42:41,t1_dgo4e8b,676e39,What are some points in the PC vs Console argument in favor of the latter?

It doesn't sound like you understood my first point at all.  My point had nothing to do with tech.


Let me put it this way.  If a gazillion console gamers are offering $60 each for a game, then the developer will gladly allocate $150+ million for a game's budget.  Some of these AAA games these days have budgets that eclipse major Hollywood films.  That's how console games have such great production values.


The demand for PC games is comparatively small.  Developers are NOT going to spend $150 million for a PC exclusive.

dgq1hkj,"I mean, I'm not really going to dispute that the PC is a much superior platform for gaming - it quite clearly is, but I'm just giving some reasons as to why I don't personally own one right now, despite considering it. If I had no consoles and a reasonable budget to spend on a new gaming platform I would buy a PC. I'm just saying why, currently, gaming on consoles works for me and I have no major motivation to switch over. The next thing I'll probably get is a Switch. 

1. I'll admit I haven't really looked into the opportunities for couch PC gaming that other people have mentioned - I could buy a gaming laptop which would be more portable but equally more difficult to upgrade, or have a bulky PC which is unlikely to fit in my TV stand. It's about motivation, at the end of the day - yes, I could get rid of my consoles and buy a PC with the money, but I don't really see the point right now when the PS4 suits me fine. 

2. The local CeX is a five-minute walk from my flat and is next to my gym. Trading in a game is, for me, virtually no effort. I've found that CeX offer pretty good trade-in prices, anyway. Furthermore, I'm a patient gamer - the last game I bought at full launch price was Breath of the Wild and I make a point to not buy games much over £20 if I can help it - I've got enough of a library that I can easily trade stuff in and get games that will last me a while for very little money. 

3. This is a fair point - I haven't gamed on a PC in a long time, so I don't know how it's changed. 

4. Again, fair enough - it was a minor point. 

5. PC does have more exclusives, but if someone wants to play Bloodborne, Nioh, Uncharted 4, Horizon: Zero Dawn, etc. then you need a PS4. If you want to play Zelda or Mario Kart 8 then you need a Wii U or a Switch. As I said above, I'm not saying that PC gaming isn't overall a superior option in general, but if you want to play any of the above games then you need a console. I'd agree that no game is worth the $400 people would pay for Breath of the Wild and a Switch, but there's enough stuff coming out for the Switch that it's only accurate to call that the price of the game if the only game you get is Zelda. Also, the Switch has a added feature of being able to be taken on the go, which a PC either doesn't have or has to a much more limited degree. That's not to say that PC gaming isn't better overall, but that if you want a portable Breath of the Wild, you need a Switch, and if you want to play Bloodborne of Nioh at all, you need a PS4. 

6. Yeah I know this one is a bullshit reason but I have poor impulse control and OP asked for arguments in favour of consoles - they didn't have to be good ones.

dgoois9,"1. Builds require specialist knowledge, which is another (albeit different) barrier to entry. Which I think is the fairer comment, consoles have lower barrier to entry, be that cost OR knowledge. Sure, I could get a console standard PC cheaper than a console if I wanted to spend hours learning what the fuck I'm doing, but tbh, fuck that - I want to use my free time playing games not researching how to play expensive lego first (I just paid for someone to make my PC, which drove the cost up significantly)

2. Bugs are definitely more common on PC in my experience. Pc is nowhere near as bad as its often painted, but while it is not as uniform as console, there will always be the odd weird bug. I do not have a Frankenstein PC at all, but it comes up with waay more issues than my ps4 despite me playing on it less (all of which are very minor, but still irritating)

3. While I think console still has a small advantage here, I don't think this is a massive advantage in and of itself tbh, but its a heck of a lot easier to set up/do on console in general imo, just by virtue of that box being designed for the communal front room, and ease of use is a huge factor for a lot of people

4. I cba to do the maths for which is better in which circumstance, but both have pros and cons, cheaper up front vs trade in ability.

5. That isn't what he is saying. He is saying that if you bought a 360 with Bioshock, you are guaranteed to be able to run Bioshock infinite because it is designed for the system. It is very possible you buy a PC for Bioshock that can't run Infinite 6 years later (those two games, ram requirements went from 1gb to 2gb, graphic cards min went from 6600 -> 8800 - which is incidentally higher than most estimates for a xb360 card, which seems to be equivalent to about 7900). If you're at the high end that isn't a problem, but it can be an issue if you buy/build a ""console standard"" PC to meet your own entry requirements (see point 1)

dgp5waa,"I dunno. Graphics can make a really big deal. I freaking love seeing beautiful things. I want to enjoy the most artistic game I can. Draw distance is something that can seriously make a big difference and yet can be easy to hit limits on before you reach a point that you're happy with. 

Who hasn't played a game where you can see objects just magically pop into view (especially details like grass)? Or where an enemy can somehow get out of sight even when you should be able to see them? Or maybe you're weirdly unable to hit them even with a ranged weapon that should be able to. It's one of those settings that can be worth taking a little time to tweak. 

And certainly the difference between a high end PC and a console for the same game is very noticeable (and is even more noticeable when mods are used, which is a whole nother issue). It can be just plain nice to see these differences.

dgq6cgq,"well kinda. http://sonic.wikia.com/wiki/Category:PC_games 

SEGA was once right up there with Nintento. the Dreamcast killed their Hardware division but they still make games. Also remember the old days of consoles wasn't really about the hardware, Exclusives got your hardware in houses so you had more presence than the competition which got you more licensing fees. Those fees were where Nintendo made bank. these days it's subscription services where the money is (playstation network, Xbox Live etc, ) which provides features most PC players expect for free. 

As for the current situation Nintendo has enough money to weather multiple ""failed"" or ""weak"" hardware releases and (fortunately or unfortunately depending on your preference) they have IP strong enough to drive sales of their system by themselves. 

While Netflix at this time is pretty ubiquitous I could easily see a future where another streaming service takes over and they decide to drop out of the streaming service and instead stick to their studios and just license shows to other services.


As for no Consoles. if they never existed that would be one thing. If they stopped now it would be for market reasons. but even then I think the console concept is inevitable. I all consoles magically vanished eventually someone would build a [console PC](http://store.steampowered.com/hardware/) to seek the mass-appeal ease-of-use crowd. Which would be fine with me since likely those games would play on my PC fine and that's all I want.   

also PC exclusives usually aren't arbitrary, often it's because the developers found it easier to work on the PC (lot of different development possible on the PC without a dev kit). other times it's to utilize the greater potential of the PC or the game itself is best suited for it but also because it's a lot cheaper.  An old ps3 dev kit could cost $10,000 the PS4 is better at $2,500, admittedly the console market is waaaay more friendly now to indie developers than in the past. 10 years ago if I had a game idea and the personal skill I could code it all up on my PC, buy a cheap domain sell it with paypal for next to nothing where getting it on a console would be super expensive.  The PC market is the most friendly indie environment but the consoles aren't as far behind as before, though I feel competition with the PC is part of the reason. 




all in all I'm not too bad off, Microsoft is already pushing a [combined envelope](https://www.vg247.com/2016/07/05/all-xbox-one-games-coming-pc-windows-10-play-anywhere/) so I'll get access to those games.  For Nintendo since they play the low-hardware-specs game emulation is far more feasible for their systems so likely I will get to play all their games on my system of choice too (maybe a new Bleem-like contender will pop up).  

As for Sony. probably never get those which is a shame, there's a few I'd like to try but not worth the hardware cost to me personally since I have so many other options so I end up falling into a lost market segment.

It plays games seemlessly with no input lag(none that I can detect at least). Any game that's not on steam can fairly easily be added as a non-steam game, or you can just minimize big picture and get to your computers desktop background and launch it through there.

dgohk0x,"I have a cheap used Dell latitude laptop setup for my projector. It's good enough to stream but not beefy enough to render the games itself. It is however very inconspicuous as it takes up less space than the receiver. I use big picture and a steam controller to launch and play the games which stream from my gaming machine in another room.

Big picture has improved greatly over the last year or so although it still has issues from time to time, mostly when I try to in-home stream games that aren't actually steam games. My wife and I play a lot of point-and-click adventure games as that's an overlap in our gaming interests and the steam controller works very well for them even the 90s era games. It eliminates the need for a clunky wireless keyboard and mouse laying around the room.

That all being said, I don't generally use that setup for anything but games. Technically I have access to the steam web browser and the steam controller still works if I'm not in the big picture interface so I could browse chrome as well but I find the virtual keyboard annoying if I try to use it for anything beyond the occasional need to type something in a game. 

I don't think SteamOS would get you where you want to go either: Non-steam stuff would still be a potential hitching point. I'm not playing PC Overwatch from the couch anytime soon. 

For me and steam games, this setup is exactly as convenient as booting up a console. It's actually easier if I'm switching between games as the PS4 requires a physical media change for most games I own.

Fair call, though the burden of proof falls on OP first. I can happily provide plenty of examples of local-coop games which work just as well on PC via TV or otherwise as they work on console.

- Kane and Lynch
- Trine
- Dungeon Defenders
- Orcs Must Die 
- Castle Crashers

- LEGO games
- Divinity original sin
- LOTR: ROTK

So basically there is no objective difference. Subjectively on platform or the other might be better. 

So yes, there are more games a lot of which are trash on PC, but as I mentioned earlier, no accounting for unplayable indi's there is an equal number of games across platforms.

dgpsmny,"1. If you think that buying assembling a lego-esque set of components following a set of strict and specific instructions is a high barrier of entry... Then i rest my case. Guess i'm overestimating the competence and intelligence of an average console gamer. Just a quick side note - my 10yo brother (who has no interest in tinkering with hardware or any special knowledge) was able to assemble the PC we bought for him in couple hours following an online guide without any trouble, so...
2. Quite the opposite in my experience. Unless you're using a weird PC or are messing with the game (cheats, console, mods, trying to outsmart the game) or are running some weird intrusive software like antivirus or video capture - bugs are the same in both versions, only if bug is found on console version 2 weeks after release - no one bothers patching it, on PC someone will make a mod to fix it. That's the only difference. And obviously i don't count the ""broken fucing piece of shite"" game like anything Bethesda makes - i meant game that some care actually went into.
3. Once again, not true. You can just easily plug a controller into PC to get the same unit multiplayer if it's supported. And when its normal local or online multiplayer - PC has way more advantages since it has better server infrastructure (well, at least Steam) and has other exclusive things like dedicated servers, LAN games, etc. So if anything - PC is far more MP oriented than consoles.
5. Once again - bollocks. If you bought a PC with the same specs as the console to run your BS - it will run Infinite just as well as the console would (wich means piss poor, but still). PC requirement don't get raised for no arbitrary reason compared to console ones. If a console can run it - then the PC with similar specs can too. This is a simple math.
6. Oh yes, let's include the cases of intentional sabotage of PC versions in favor of console ones, that's a great illustration of how consoles are better than PCs. /s",NekoiNemo,1,2017-04-25 04:39:07,t1_dgoois9,676e39,What are some points in the PC vs Console argument in favor of the latter?

That's only true if you go completely digital on console and/or need everything day one.  The online stores on consoles have been getting better about sales, but they still don't beat physical game pricing, especially a few weeks after release.  Physical games routinely fall to $40-$30 just a few months or even weeks after release.  Obviously, this is only applicable to games that can be found on PC and console.  Nintendo games also hardly, if ever, drop much in price, but that's a Nintendo thing.

dgobfjd,">PCs certainly have more local multiplayer experiences than Nintendo, but Nintendo clearly are one of the few big companies who seem to really care about local multiplayer, and I'd like to get a Wii U soon.

I guess overall that's true in terms of sheer game numbers.  That said, there are some games that have local coop on consoles but not PC, including a lot of the rare AAA games that have local coop nowadays.  I bought both the Borderlands games and Diablo 3 on console, despite generally preferring both genres on PC, for example, because both games only have local coop on consoles (although apparently there are ways to get splitscreen working in Borderlands on PC).

So to some extent, it depends on preference, and whether there are specific games you're looking for, which I guess is always a factor in PC versus console.  Really, by any metric PC's always going to win in sheer game quantity versus consoles.

dgpp30q,"I think there's a few ways this could come about:

1) These are supposed to be VR-supporting consoles. Presumably this implies that the PS4 and XBone aren't strong enough for it... which means that any VR game is going to be an exclusive to the Pro or Scorpio (or even both). This is already going to set up a bit for such.

2) Exclusives sell consoles. What's the point of buying a PS4 Pro or a XBox Scorpio if there's nothing new you can play on it? That's a bunch of extra money for what end? This seems like a dangerous road - doubly so given the XBone doesn't have the greatest install base to begin with. That strikes me as an incentive to produce Scorpio games to sell systems... and also screw over Sony, because the PS4 has a larger install base. Microsoft might try to force an install base reset - which would be a dangerous gambit, as it would be doing the same to itself, but it could put Sony in a Morton's Fork type situation.

3) It seems unlikely any company would *deliberately* only design something for the Scorpio or Pro without a financial incentive due to their low install base... but it is possible that a PC-first design might end up out of spec for the lower-end systems, which could lead to aforementioned issue.

kempauq,"I've historically been a console user, but transitioned to PC gaming during the pandemic.

What made the PC gaming transition very easy for me was the Steam Deck, it really does create a ""console-like"" introduction to PC gaming. I generally rarely use mods, nor do I care for performance min-maxing, etc.

Since I'm coming from consoles, so long as I get a reasonable 30-60fps with reasonable graphics, I'm good to go for my games.

For a former console user like myself, Windows on these handhelds is really rough and a terrible user experience. Having to manage the desktop is a huge negative for console users, there's too much fiddling and driver management, registry hacks, disabling lockscreens (compromising security), whatever. It's all too fiddly.

Thankfully the LGO is a pretty phenomenal Linux device, so I've been getting something like 90% of the SteamOS experience on the LGO. In my opinion, Linux makes this device a totally valid console competitor.

Windows is great for power users and full blown PC gaming, but if you want a game console like experience, I've found that it's severely lacking.

TL;DR - Microsoft please make a dedicated gaming mode in Windows already. Oh, and also fix sleep.",Tsuki4735,6,2023-12-23 17:05:13,t3_18p9937,18p9937,PC vs Console People

ken94za,"I've been on PC since the late 90s and am a software developer. I get annoyed by some things. Anytime there's some type of input conflict that is solved by closing Legion Space, Steam, or any other launcher. Anytime I try to open an EA game and it opens the EA launcher and it fails to launch the game so you keep trying to launch the game until it actually opens. EA Launcher I don't get, sometimes it remembers my login and other times it doesn't. I didn't bother signing into it for a couple weeks and now it's auto signing in correctly even though the last time I actually signed in was weeks ago

Any game that has controller support in the primary game and the gameplay menu but not in some of the startup game menus. So you have to use the touch screen or touchpad to launch the game. Also if the game doesn't autodetect controller input and you have to navigate the small menu buttons and find the controller type setting.

Anything that can't be modified well solely with the gamepad sticks and buttons and you have to use the touchpad or touchscreen is pretty bad usability with the gamepads attached. Take off the gamepads

It's all stuff I can deal with. Others, it's a harder sell.

kenz5ra,"examples of stuff that breaks the console-like experience on Windows that I've run into:

- whenever the device locks, and I have to unlock via entering a password or pin via touchscreen
  - especially bad when docked to a TV, I need to walk up to my TV for to use the touchscreen
  - workaround via disabling lock screen is not viable for me since it compromises security 
- whenever I want to quickly swap to my browser to look something up, then swap back to the game when docked to a TV
  - can't be done easily via controller only, I have to walk up to the device again, or hook up an external keyboard and mouse
- every time I open a game that can't deal with the portrait screen, I have to go down an internet rabbit hole to figure out if it's easy to fix or not
  - some games are not fixable at all on Windows since they're rotated upside-down due to the portrait screen being rotated in the wrong direction on the LGO
- connecting the device to a TV or monitor, only for it to be upside down or sideways on the TV/monitor due to the portrait screen
- Windows updates, especially when they automatically start in the background and slow down games
- whenever focus is on the wrong window, so I have to manually tap the screen to change focus to whatever window or game I want focused
  - again, particularly bad when docked to a TV
  - LGO controller remapping should eventually solve this by enabling alt-tab via controller
  - trackpad on the LGO controllers also allows for working around this, but doesn't work with Xbox controllers
- wonky sleep
  - thankfully hibernation works fine here
- install latest drivers, or roll back drivers, etc, for specific games. Lots of driver management
- etc

This isn't even everything that I've experienced, this is just stuff that I can think of off the top of my head.

Every single issue I mentioned here is a non-issue with Linux on the LGO.

Now that's not to say that Linux on the LGO doesn't have issues, but Linux is currently far better suited to be a console OS than Windows.
