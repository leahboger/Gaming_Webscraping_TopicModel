jri7kjg,"If you're using windows it doesn't matter. The game has ""Xbox Play anywhere"" so once you buy it on one platform you own it on both. It also has cross platform progression so there's no need to choose one device to play on. You could play on console at home and pick up where you left off on a laptop while you're on a trip. As long as you're logged into the same Microsoft account that is.

Edit: my bad, got it mixed up with Infinite. It's not an Xbox Play anywhere game. So I'd recommend getting it on PC since you get the extra graphics and display settings that are standard in most PC games. Otherwise the experience isn't really any different since it has cross platform multiplayer.",llMithrandirll,2,2023-07-11 06:30:26,t3_14wilja,14wilja,PC or Console?

Buying it on Steam gives you full access to all of the mods on Steam Workshop and with tomorrow's update, there's going to be **A LOT** of new stuff that modders will be able to do, like bringing forward a ton of cut maps from Halo 2, Halo 3, etc and even work on ODST Multiplayer.

A slightly important note is Halo 1 has a memory leak problem in the Campaign currently if you have AMD hardware. This *should* be fixed tomorrow when the new update drops, so if you have AMD hardware, I'd hold off actually starting your playthrough until tomorrow.",Ryan_WXH,2,2023-07-11 11:53:20,t3_14wilja,14wilja,PC or Console?

I know COD has strong aim assist, and Apex Legends has a bit weaker aim assist, but you at least know it's there.

I prefer using the gamepad because it's nostalgic for me, but I feel like I'm putting myself at a disadvantage if I don't use MKB.

hl07iwx,Apparently when you boot the game up for the first time make sure you dont press the Enter key on your keyboard to get into the main menu. This disables aim assist for whatever reason as the game continues to think you’re using mouse and keyboard. There’s an article on charlieintel about it and that was tested by several other people on twitter.

hkzajkb,"Yes - there is aim assist on PC controller. You can confirm this by placing your cursor on a player/bot and watch it slightly move.

However, there are some serious issues with optimization for controller players. Aiming is ""busted"" right now, and I think 343 is doing it intentionally. Bullet magnetism, strength of aim assist, and controller stick optimization are all out of whack. Other shooters feel 10x better than Infinite, and I'm not sure if 343 is going address the issue. 

343 has alluded to controller aiming being tweaked to create skill gaps and be more competitive with MKB players. Instead, they're alienating their core player base (Xbox consoles) by making it harder to aim and not as enjoyable.",Ehorn36,12,2021-11-17 12:28:12,t3_quu6gt,quu6gt,PC Controller Aim Assist?

hl8ttd6,"ok so I've been playing on PC with controller everyday since launch and I'm having a great time with the game although I did feel it was quite challenging to get kills consistently & I was getting wrecked a lot which is fine I enjoy the challenge and it left me with a sense of admiration for these other random players that I thought were amazing at this game.

Yesterday I downloaded the game onto my son's xsx and I tried it out to make sure it was working and to set up the controls etc.  Holy shit what a difference I was absolutely  smashing everyone you literally put the crosshair on them, it locks on like an actual fucking aimbot, you pull the trigger and they die lol wtf.

It is like playing two completely different versions of the same game.

Anyway I'm quite happy playing on PC with controller as it is just chiming in my two cents on this.

Now I don't know if the PC version has no aim assist or just a toned down version of the XSX aimbot but the difference between the two is absolutely night & day.

Idk why Microsoft continues to let 343 destroy the once great franchise, they did okay with Halo 5, but this game has a lot of issues that makes me think they let whoever came up with the idea of Halo 4 make some changes to the game. Infinite is a step in the wrong direction if they don't fix some of these issues. Force crossplay for ranked, and no aim assist being one of two HUGE ones.

And the AA is strong but for me its kinda of a hindrance, im used to weaker aim assist so i find myself fighting against the pull often, i don't expect the game to pull so hard so i end up fighting against it. It feels like a cartoon scene where one character forces their help onto another, they fight over an object and end up falling over, breaking something and causing a catastrophe only its my reticle every fight. Like the sniper feels so janky for me, i know where i have to put my sight, but AA pulls me to a place i dont need to be and i end up firing just barely off.

I play all fps games with M&K and haven't used a controller since Halo 5 on Xbox, but Halo is Halo so it felt weird using M&K.

The aim assist lent to console vs the quickness of a mouse is a difficult thing to balance, and it varies with every game. Ultimately they are different mediums. Why make console play against players who can flick shot when you cant? Why make PC player play against people who play with what is essentially an aimbot? The starting weapons in this game are tracking based so aim assist has advantage. But then there are precision weapons with which pc has advantage. It is impossible to balance.

There’s someone on OG Xbox One that’s upset about the guy on Xbox One X getting 4K and having a clearer picture and better frame rate, but that guy is mad at the player on the Series S getting 60FPS, and that guy is mad at the other Series S player who has a 120Hz monitor, and that person is mad at the Series X player with the 4K120FPS setup.  I won’t even get into the differences between players TVs/monitors, Elite controllers, etc.  There’s just already so much variety out there giving little edges to other people.

hkszav2,"Lets debunk some things:

* So, with my 2 year old, mid-tier PC, I am getting 80ish FPS at 1440p. So, 20 more FPS that you are? My system also cost 3 times as much as yours. I would hope it performed better than an Xbox.
* You're also assuming that every PC player is running MnK, which they aren't. 
* I guarantee every single pro is going to be running this on PC, along with anyone who wants to be at the peak of competitive. So, PC (MnK) Halo will never be taken out of competitive. Plus if you look at Apex or Warzone, almost every pro/high-level streamer will tell you that controller is much better to run for the sole purpose of, wait for it, **AIM ASSIST**. So, if you are equally as good as someone playing on PC, you might 48-49 out of 100 fight solely based on your 15ms input lag, instead of 50/50. 
* If 343 actually cares about the game, and doesn't just want to suck every single teeny tiny penny out of it, cheaters shouldn't be a problem. Once again, look at Apex. The only time you run into cheaters in Apex is at the TOP TOP echelon, and they get banned usually by the end of the day. That's because they use EasyAntiCheat, and have team members who actively, in-the-moment, check claim. Guess who doesn't do that? Activi$ion...

But yeah, I agree with you. Some players will be better with a controller while others will be better with K&M.

hlcfobb,"I have only played CE with MnK and that was in the late 2000’s or something so I couldn’t compare. Infinite definitely feels incredibly natural as a MnK game which I think is good as that is the direction FPS has been going for a while now. 

Interestingly I’m quite good at snapping onto players with sniper on controller, I feel like a major barrier for me to improve on it is confidence. When I first pick it up I’m real hype and can go snappy headshots, but give me any time to make a decision and I overthink the aim and timing. 

I will say, regardless of how MnK is, my relationship with the controller feels much more personal. There’s such a long history there that defines so many formative experiences for me, as weird as it is to pin so much on a video game. 

As personal as the controller is, I also don’t think about it at all. I recorded my controller for the duration of a halo game the other day and like, wtf are my hands doing. All so smooth in game, as natural as walking and talking, and my fingers are actually just freaking the fuck out over this controller lmao.
