@JosephStefanatny,2024-08-21T21:42:35Z,0,"If you are a gamer, and dont want to waste you time on tech problems, buy a console. You get high end performance for low price ( relatively ),   You get optimal user experience and you dont need to waste hours on building, optimizing and understanding all that you need to know to run things on PC. With console you get the experience that every  gamer really wants, boot up and play with no complications. Lets consider the electricity cost, PC is going to eat up way more, if you play games for many hour a day consistently. The game quality and performance is going to be about compromises but, does it really mater if it will always work well on console ? Subscriptions on consoles are bad, but are they really so horrible? A high tier PC will eat up around 500 - 600w a console like the Xbox series X will cost 160w ( average ). If you play a lot,  you will pay way more for the electricity annually  with PC then with the console for electricity and services  combined. Use PC only If you love working with it, want to use computing power for more then gaming and want the best of the best waist of money in the division of tech!",GgJj9Mok9dA,True
@TahirZiaGaming,2024-08-21T19:35:18Z,0,"My top 5 reasons for console over pc:
1. Directly focus on game, no need for configuration, tweating, controller setup... just start a game and have fun.
2. Couch play, tv hookup easy
3. Low cost as compared to pc
4. Even in perfect settings on pc, i had really bad experience of game crashes constantly. Bcoz where i live, everything is pirated from windows to softwares, no laws stopping them. So when gaming on a pc which is loaded with pirated windows, and softwares, anything can go wrong.
5. After every few years, newer games tend to be more demanding in pc and the same pc which was built using 2000$ and was able to play latest game on ultra, now struggle on medium. So constant upgrade is frustrating. Busy person, busy life, just get only a day or two in a week, so dont want to waste that on configuring things rather than actually playing game.",GgJj9Mok9dA,True

@CinnabonMcTasty,2024-08-19T17:25:10Z,0,"Little back story. I'm 40 years old I come from a background when PCMR had a lot of reasons for being such. Building gaming PCs on into around 2009 I took a break from it, just went casual with PS3s, PS4, PS5 recently the last couple years. Got my GF into gaming and we play games together on her Series X and myself on the PS5. Console had big limitations to me, it wasn't graphics. Series X / PS5 are freaking good, to say otherwise you're just part of the problem. The limitation lies on 2 things, small game developer support, PC games just have that market down, a lot of GOOD lesser known games never see consoles. Secondly is input devices, As an old school PC gamer what do I know best? keyboard and mouse. And while for the last 2 years I did play games like Warzone with KBM on PS5 at a desk, its very very limited, only a handful of decent titles support it. So when recently my GF and I built new gaming PCs with 4070 TI Super and 4080 Super respectively, in the last few weeks the game library of stuff we can play together has EXPLODED. But it was NOT cheap, it was something we talked about for quite some time before dropping well on into $7000 between the systems and monitors to do. a MAJOR leap over a $500 console. But was it worth it in 2024. 100%",GgJj9Mok9dA,True

I can go from emulation to ps5 titles in a mouse click. Is it couch friendly no, but devices like steam deck is helping fill that gap. I absolutely hate supporting multiple console hardware to play games. If we can get Nintendo ass onboard to port some stuff to PC officially, I know I'm done at that point with consoles. This is not a rag on consoles, it's great for those who don't want to invest the time and money in PC. But PC let me go all the way back to the original doom up to Gow Ragnarok.

I loved the PS2, and the PS3 had so many great games and a Blu-ray player.... it was a great console (I still have it, but haven't played in years).  That was my last serious time doing any gaming. Now, I'm trying to get back into gaming, and incidentally needed a new laptop, so I intentionally got a gaming oriented one (Legion 7i gen9 with a 14900HX, a 4090, and 32gb of RAM).

The problem is... I completely underestimated how steep the learning curve was going to be breaking into PC gaming with my last gaming experience being a PS3 ages ago.  I have no desire to be a ""serious"" gamer. I do not have the time nor the inclination to get good enough to play some of these online open world multi-player behemoths well enough to actually enjoy the experience. I just want to have a nice escape when I can squeeze in some fun, not a second job.  

My laptop doubles for work, something this model pulls off very well because it doesn’t scream GAMING laptop.

@guerillatactix3834,2024-08-15T21:41:22Z,0,"PC is what I picked.

1) Upgrade paths. That means you don't need to buy a whole new box to play ""next gen"" games. It could be something as simple a $100 upgrade to ram or the type of storage you're using. Lets be real here, PS5 cost $500 for what is essentially an $80 M.2 drive and a controller with features that 95% of games don't use. Outside of that, there isnt much of a difference between PS4 and PS5.

2) Setting can be customized to turn off things that cause motion sickness, like adjusting field of view and disabling motion blur. Not to mention you can adjust your frame rates, play in aspect ratios not available on consoles, etc.

3) Its a PC so it can be used for more than media content and gaming. I use an art application, use type documents, have video calls, etc.

4) Game selection, from most console exclusives, to games console people have never known existed. Plus my games transfer between PCs so I don't need decade old consoles collecting dust. One PC is all I need to collect dust and not have my house look like a Gamestop from 2005.

5) There is no online subscription with PCs. There are games with subscription costs, but I'm not paying twice to use the internet I already pay for. As someone who doesn't have a ton of cash, spending $2,000 on a PC which will last me roughly 7 years before I need to upgrade any parts was just more cost effective.",GgJj9Mok9dA,True

@ceiis2013,2024-08-13T11:57:56Z,0,"PC's have so much freedom to do whatever you want them to do and whatever you want to do. Upgrade,  download mods, make mods, make your own game, pirate, pick an OS, do work, do projects, has a much larger catalog of games, etc etc etc... 

And most modern graphics cards and CPUs will outclass consoles bar none. Console hardware is usually 5 years behind PC hardware at launch. 

The hardware in a PS5 is equivalent to medium to high level PC hardware from 2016, and graphically speaking about the level of a 2060 RTX (mainly because of raytracing, perhaps a 1070 or 1080 without considering raytracing).

Unless you're really strapped for cash, are a fanboy of Xbox/Sony, getting it for a kid, or really want to play the exclusives asap, I'd highly recommend getting a well reviewed prebuilt or picking out the parts and have someone else like a computer shop build you one, or even build one yourself.",GgJj9Mok9dA,True

Figure out your wants, expectations, and budget. What games are you planning on playing? Do you want to run games on medium settings or maxed? Lots of games don't require 4090's to play on max settings, a 3060/3070 might do you just fine. Do you care about a flashy case with lots of rgb fans, or are you okay with a cheap plain case?

@shawalfida6357,2024-08-13T06:47:35Z,0,"Had an alienware 17 laptop 
Was an impulse buy back in 2014 
Had it for 10 years
It was great, bought lots of discounted games on steam

Eventually just played fifa 17 repetitively with a cheap usb controller just to kill time abit

Should've gotten a budget laptop
Ps4 n cheap tv, it would've still cost less than the laptop tho....

I had a ps1 & ps2 prior... no ps3  n ps4.

But i got my ps5 at launch for retail.
Got it in my hands january 2021
Now fully immersed in ps5 ecosystem.
Friend gave me his cyberpunk ps4 disc,
So got to play that for free once the ps5 update came out much2 later

I will however plan to save some money perhaps to buy a pc to replay cyberpunk again in all its glory ( phantom dlc).

PS5 is just amazing
60 fps
Fast boot, fast loading which is life changing, meaning you get to enjoy playing ( and dying ) more
Dual sense is just nuts, u get to feel everything, the triggers, 
In GT7 , the gearchanges can be felt, and the weight of the cars too, its insane


From my own personal experience,

Ur game only looks and feels as good as the your display.
Played on 65 inch basic TU8000 samsung tv, god of war was epic tho
But the couch and floor was not good for posture

So i play my console on a monitor
Now ps5 supports 1440p with VRR ( must have hdmi 2.1)
Initially it was asus VG27AQL1A, superb,
Now alienware AW2725DF, QD-oled, response time is crazy, games looks phenomenal. Will buy ps5 pro later and sell this OG console.

27 inch 1440p is the sweet spot.
Sharpness is the same like a 65 inch 4k tv at viewing distance.
I zoomed in on the football in fifa games replay to see the sharpness, its the same.
And QD oled is just better than ips.
Oled response time is unbeatable.

I too have the same ikea chair jay uses. Markkus!.
My dual sense won't have low battery cuz i can just plug it in to recharge and play.

And if im buying a pc later to play some games ( if ever ) , 1440p won't tax the gpu too much compare to 4k.

My advice would be.
( ignore said advice if u can afford everything)

1) if u need frill free gaming, get a ps5, you'll love gaming again.

2) if u need to work, get a basic refurbished pc / laptop 

3) if your work requires u to get a powerful pc / laptop, then you can splurge on a gaming pc / laptop

4) i wouldn't advise anyone to get a gaming laptop unless they can afford to change it every 3 years because manufacturers / official distributors only keep bespoke parts for 3 years. Had to outsourced to replace my alienware screen before i can sell it. Changed it myself.

5) if u travel for work
Get a steamdeck and a budget laptop

** 2 device is better than 1 in case it breaks mid journey **

Gaming laptop still needs to be plugged in to game.

Budget laptop with long battery life can stream video content for longer.

Now ps ecosystem has the portal, but still depends on what type of games u play.",GgJj9Mok9dA,True

Time to upgrade to the newest OS. Sorry your computer isn't good enough to use the new OS. Go buy a new computer or buy a new Motherboard, CPU, RAM and graphics card to work with your new updated system. 6 to 7 years down the road your high end PC is not high end and you repeat steps to upgrade your computer again. 

I get it with the console and the new system comes along and if you want to play the latest and greatest you need to upgrade your console. Both systems have their up's and downs. Most of the games that are last generation on Console are now being compatible not by disk, but by a digital copy. 

I have had PC's built my own a couple times. When the Windows OS 11 came out. I get a message my freaking computer that was high end just 6 years ago isn't compatible because freaking Windows made it so! I do have an iMac now and a couple gaming consoles. If I need the web or need to do video editing I use the iMac or the iPhone. One thing for sure, You cannot build a PC including OS with a decent graphics card anywhere near a $500 dollar range dedicated to gaming that is good and not crap like you can with a dedicated gaming console. You are going to be paying 3 to 4x's that for a sweet gaming PC after the CPU, Motherboard, RAM, computer case, power supply, SSD, cooling system and buying a copy of Windows or Linux to set it up.

So other than the PS4 Pro that I got as I was bored an heard it could be hacked as after the crap Sony pulled with the PS3, I had zero care about giving them the middle finger as that was their attitude to their customers until they were humbled by them, I saw no point in the consoles and my PCs were far more than just gaming machines, so the console money was better spent on them.

While I cannot afford a $2,000 PC, which is the only way I would get value of it, a $500 console is all you need. You do need to spend some money for PS+ or Xbox Game Pass. It's like $80 a year. I switched from a $1,000 PC I got almost 5 years ago to PS5 and I love it. Yes, I lost access to some PC exclusive games and my former game library, but most of them I don't intend to play again. At the same time, I got access to some games that I could never play on PC, such as Until Dawn. A ton of games also support crossprogression nowadays, so besides buying online buy to play games like Dead by Daylight or Call of Duty, if you played a game once, you don't need to touch it again. Also, if you get physical edition, you can buy second hand games for PS4 and then play the PS5 version. I also noticed that some games are cheaper if you buy it physically and it is always cheaper when you buy it second hand. You can then sell it when you finish the game, so you get some of your money back. I 100% recommend PS5, but wait for thr pro edition releasing later this year. If you just got a $1,700+ PC in the last 2 years, wait until PS6 comes out in 2028. PS is also better than Xbox because of the exclusives. However, old games from PS-PS3 era don't work on PS5. So if you like older games, go for Xbox. Call of Duty fans should always go for Xbox. You can play almost all call of duty games and more if you have the ultimate edition subscription for $139 per year.",GgJj9Mok9dA,True

@havocthedemonicliger328,2024-08-06T08:34:59Z,0,"Well, I would argue with you there that PC is not going to last longer than a console when it comes to gaming specifically, unless you upgrade most of the components over time. That´s why I switched from PC to PS4 for single player gaming. I´m a huge Mass Effect fan, and my old PC could no longer handle the requirements of Mass Effect 3 at the time. So I bargained with my parents to get me ""a laptop for school"" of my choice. Yes, I did not get anything super crazy high end spec, but close to a thousand € build, Mass Effect 3 run buttery smooth and I was happy. Until ONLY four years later that is, when Andromeda came out and I found myself out-speced again! And when I found out that I can get a PS4 slim for the price of GTX1060 (recommended spec for Andromeda), a one component alone, the choice was clear. It seems to me that for the price of future proofing a PC for 7 years (the average lifespan of a console, if even possible) you can get the console itself and goooood chunk of games before the cost odds of building a future proofed PC would even out.",GgJj9Mok9dA,True

I unfortunately recently bought a intel focused gaming PC. Intel Arc GPU and Intel CPU.

@wingingit9493,2024-08-02T15:34:11Z,0,"I've been water cooling and oc'ing since the IBM XT. Yep I've been at it a while. 2022 my main desktop was getting long on the tooth. I have consoles around for the grandkids. I have no use for them. So I went to build a new high end desktop. And one afternoon of shopping I figured out. Nope not putting that kind of money into a new desktop. Prices were absolutely insane. I took that money earmarked for the PC build and went and bought a new 2022 Yamaha MT-09 that I found a deal on. 2023 rolled around and I revisited a new PC build. Nope none of it was worth that kind of money. Freaking stupid what it was going to cost. So I started looking into laptops. While not the best lappys and far from the worse I ended up with a Lenovo 7 Slim 13900H, 4070, 1tb storage, 16 gig of ram and a Lenovo 7 Pro 13900HX, 4090, 1tb storage, 16gig of ram. Took the storage and ram out of the 7 Pro and put them in the 7 Slim. Then added two 2tb Sammy 980 Pro's and put 32gig of ram in the 7 Pro and called it good. Next time I clean the 7 Pro I have 64 gig of 5800 Ram to go in it I won in a local contest. Both machines ram runs at 5800 with solid timings. I got both of the lappys bought new in the box and upgrades done for far less than the new PC build. Put a couple of 120mm fans on a bakers rack that is adjustable for the 7 Pro and set it up on my desk with a TCL 55"" TV hacked to run at 144hz refresh and called it good. Is the lappy desktop as fast and flexible as a water cooled custom desktop with the same desktop components,,,,, NO. Close but no cigar. And I ended up with a new completely mobile laptop that's far better than my old Asus i5 and i7 lappys. I've had both these lappy over a year now and not a issue one. I'll build a new desktop at some point. But right now these lappys are working great and I can spend money on my motorcycles, guns, reloading components, shooting daily if I want and nice steak dinners with the wife.",GgJj9Mok9dA,True

I bought my PS5 with Rift Apart, and I enjoyed the game, but I just really found it difficult to bring myself to play on the PS5 because of the controller and the limited fps, the limited customization in the settings sucks as well.

I'd still rather pay $10,000 for a PC than be given a free console, it's automatically a win if I can enjoy gaming. I have full control in shooting games with a mouse and any mistake is my own fault. I feel like thumbsticks offer little control and sensitivity varies between situations whereas a mouse I can tinker it to be a jack of all trades. That's really what it comes down to, the PC can do anything I want it to, the console can't.

I also can't connect my external headphones amplifier and DAC with my Focal headphones to my PS5 due to it not supporting external DACs, the PS3 I can because it has an optical port.

First to add to this, there's no mention of Nintendo here, which is a real viable option with killer exclusive games and a great form factor to play on the TV or on the go.  I don't own a Playstation at all mostly because I can get this from the Switch and of course the games now on Steam for PC.  Sure the hardware is old and it will be replaced soon, but its the best console out there IMHO.  Now to refute the PC argument, upgradability.  I hear this all the time and one thing to really thing about is you are extremely limited on how and what you can upgrade.  In my experience ""upgrading"" means dumping a lot of parts, usually the most expensive ones, and keeping a few older ones.  Motherboard sockets change, GPUs require more power, cooling systems aren't compatible with new chipsets, and the price of it all.  How often is anyone here upgrading their GPU without also having to upgrade (really replace) their motherboard/CPU/RAM too?  Especially if you have the system for 5+ years.",GgJj9Mok9dA,True

@samulai,2024-07-27T15:32:38Z,1,"I have both and both have their advantages. Hell, my PS5 is now faster than my PC because I can't justify upgrading it. 
Some games on PC are horribly made, and the mouse movement is weirdly accelerated, or almost granular, or ""floaty"" and that is by far the biggest issue I absolutely loathe in PC games. It makes gaming feel like wrestling with the controls. These games are few, luckily, and often tweaks can be made to make it better.
On console however, some games are limited to 30fps, again, only few these days, but personally that makes the game unplayable. That feels like trying to run in a nightmare.

So obviously, owning both makes sense, but I also hate having to own two systems. I don't even have the kind of time, peace of mind and energy to play games, as I had when I was in my teens.

For some, a console makes sense, for others, a PC.

@BERSERKERDEMON1,2024-07-24T03:32:55Z,0,"I dont agree with you...
I will tackle some of the cons you mentioned.
1/ PC is not an xbox. The xbox app is just the friend list you have on xbox. None buy PC games on the Microsoft store, everyone goes for Steam for the sales and the modding community. So even if you do have the xbox app, you don't get to play all your games with your xbox friends list on xbox.
2/ there is backward compatibility on console since the xbox one, and on the OneX the games run even better (1800p if not 4k) than on the classic xbox one.
3/ xbox is better than playstation in my mind (sony is struggling with the backward compatibility, doesn't offer good prices or even quality when you consider the battery life of their controller which is absolutely ridiculous (my switch joycons have better batteries).
4/ consoles in general are not anymore stucked in sub 1080 or 1080p resolution (since the one x a huge leap has been done, nearlyall games run in 4k or 1800p on consoles)
5/ a middle range computer version of a PC game (in 1080p with medium settings ) is according to you a better version of the same game on consoles... I can't agree. My previous PC (i7 4790k and Radeon 290x) was struggling to maintain 50 Fps in Halo 5 multiplayer no matter what settings  (while running flawlessly in 1800p 60Fps on my xbox oneX and in 720p 60Fps on my first xbox one)

I now own a good PC (5950x and radeon 6900XT) and make run all my games better than a console but that's because I got an exceptional bargain on my components (a deal very few people would get actually) but even with that deal the price I paid wasn't wort it now that I think about it (unfortunately the xbox series X was extremely rare and expensive during the covid pandemic where I live so... I went for the new PC because the price was a bit higher than the xbox, 1200 USD for the xbox, slightly more for the PC... so I went for the new PC...)
If I coul go back in the past I would buy the xbox despite of the price to be honnest even if I do amazing things with my PC.

6/ some consoles (/brands) are more inclined to having overheating issues but since the xbox one they are way less common... excepted on Sony 's side...)",GgJj9Mok9dA,True
@ghost_to_a_ghost,2024-07-24T03:30:51Z,0,"big facts.  i built a  PC back in 2019 with a 4-core ryzen and a 1650 but started out with a 650w PSU knowing i would be upgrading later down the road.  one of my friends who does internet security for a popular bank basically did the initial building of that PC and he taught me a lot of stuff (thanks Joshua) and i have upgraded GPU's and CPU's several times.  currently on a ryzen 7 5800x and a 4070 GPU.  installing your own parts is very rewarding.  the initial building process was a bit pricey but upgrading piece by piece is way less painful on my wallet.  if you're in it for the long haul, i say go PC.  all platforms have their benefits but the PC route is more fun for me, and i have loved learning how to do everything from flashing my mobo for a new CPU to installing AIO Coolers.  it's nice to sit down, play a badass game, and be like ""yeah!  i built this rig from the ground up!"" call me old school.  i am.  been gaming since DOOM II.  love your channel, Jay.  long time fan.",GgJj9Mok9dA,True

@ruperect1,2024-07-23T10:33:58Z,1,"If a console is left in one spot for it's entire life then, just like anything else in the home it will gather dust, the dust which has settled on it gets sucked in when the device is turned on. All of my consoles are stored away in boxes and kept dust free. They only come out of their box when i use the console and after i've used it it goes back in a box. So there is no reason for it to overheat from a blocked heatsink and dusty fan. The console will not suck in any dust during use if it has been stored in a box. So keeping a console in a box will prolong the life of a console quite considerably or even indefinitely.

If players want to to just leave their consoles sitting around gathering dust between uses then it will no doubt die in just a couple of years or so.

@Roguey,2024-07-23T10:22:01Z,0,"well I agree with most of the points; you mostly talked about the hardware side of things - which is great and that, but you didnt cover a few important things about the software. PS5 is backwards compatable with PS4 titles, and Sony have been porting over quite a lot of PSP/PS3/2 titles too. So I would say Sony have been much better at supporting older titles than they used too. As you said, in the past when you moved to a new console often most/all the games from the old system wouldnt work. 

The another thing you missed is about the software. Sony and MS offer game pass which allows you to access a catalogue of games, where I know you could access them through the MS pass, however if you use Steam/Epic etc. doesnt apply. PC also makes you have multiple accounts with different clients (like I said Epic, Steam etc.) were on MS/PS you make your account and are sorted (mostly). Buying uplay titles on Steam means downloading another client (and registering etc.)

If youre into your achivements/trophies they are all kept together unlike PC were your achivements/trophies are split across multiple clients (Steam achivements arent secured either, meaning anyone can give themself any achivements they like).

Im not saying the PC is bad or anything, just that the software can play a huge part of things - all well and great having fanastic hardware, without the software it doesnt do much. I hate having to create so many accounts on PC, fragmentating my games and my achivements/trophies.",GgJj9Mok9dA,True

@jrf7210,2024-07-20T11:40:56Z,0,"I think if you want to play PVP multiplayer games, and multiplayer FPS's like Counter Strike, Overwatch, etc PC 100 percent.  Playing FPS with a controller sucks, and the community for online games is better on PC, slightly more mature, still not at all but you can deal with older teens, to young adults on PC's while you have to deal with pre teens on consoles.  If you are into non PVP games just single player campaigns then a console may be slightly better.  That's my 2 cents. It really depends on the games you play.  Like RTS games MOAB or MOBA's or whatever they are called, all stuff like that is better on a PC, really the only think that is better on a console is like UFC games, and games you can't get on PC.  If you can only have one I would do PC 100 percent but there is a case to be made for consoles, they are cheaper, especially if you have to get a monitor and peripherals, you are talking thousands and thousands for a PC that is near the top of the line.  If you don't get one near the top of the line, then you could easily be disappointed in the performance you are getting in games, especially if you mess up and get a 4k monitor and an under powered GPU which I'm sure happens a lot to people.",GgJj9Mok9dA,True

@WesleyGilbert-uf4gc,2024-07-20T06:22:14Z,0,"I don't consider myself a hardcore gamer but I choose Gaming Consoles over an expensive PC for  these reasons. I had a less than a thousand dollar gaming PC and I had a very bad experience with it. I don't know that much about computers but I assume I had to download drivers and tinker with the graphic card settings and do all of this nonsense just for a gaming PC to run normal. MY Gaming PC crashed so many times that I sold my PC and used that money to buy a PS5 and and a Xbox Series X. It was very rare that my games crashes on my PS5  or Xbox Series X. The only time my gaming consoles crashed was when I played with alot of mods like for games like Skyrim, Fallout 4, or those glitchy games from Bethesaida. 95 percent of the time, I have a very comfortable gaming experience on Gaming consoles. With a PC, you can have outdated or old computer part and sometimes you can't even upgrade computer parts if the parts are too old which forces you to spend a lot of money to a new mothetboard, GPU, CPU, etc. 2. With a gaming console you get free updates and it is very easy to manage your gaming console. The other bad thing I can say about a gaming console is they get very hot and you better have fans to cool them off. I had my PS5 turn off because it was too hot so I built a personal fan and have it blow directly on the PS5 to cool it down while I am gaming. In my honest opinion, if I was going to get back into PC gaming, I need a minumum $1,500.00 gaming PC because I tried the under $1,000.00 PC setup and it sux and my old Playstation 4 was more reliable than it. I didnt understand how a $300.00 PS4 plays better than a $1000.00 gaming PC with no glitches and no crashes, playing the same exact games on the Steam library. In Conclusion, if you just want to play video games with no headaches and everything is set up on standard settings and ready to go. The extra money you spend on a gaming PC is just not worth it.",GgJj9Mok9dA,True

@GMMXX80,2024-07-19T21:47:08Z,0,"Yes. I'm primarily a console gamer because we were too poor to be able to afford a PC when I was kid and didn't get a Hewlett Packard until I was in Jr. High. Didn't mean I didn't have an interest in PCs..... No wait, I take that back, I had a 286 with a monitor that was orange and black..... Horrible BUT! I had an interest in PCs but didn't get A REAL one until I was in Jr. High.

Xbox is really just a small PC and as he said, Xbox blew it with the Xbox One and lost consumer trust and hasn't been able to recover since and PlayStation has been very smart about damage control to make sure they don't pull an Xbox and concede the market back to Xbox, they've been very careful so, really, Xbox didn't have much of a choice if they wanted consumers to buy their products which has come with a lot of deceit and manipulation, you gotta be a smart consumer to not fall prey and sucker to Xbox's ploys because, they're desperate right now. I've been following gaming since I was kid, I know Xbox's business management and structure, I know their corporate management and their history so, in my experience, Xbox is THE WORST GAMING COMPANY to work with and are incredibly out of touch with gaming and their corporate management have no clue how to run a game company. Nintendo and PlayStation, however, which I'm surprised he doesn't have a Nintendo Switch on the table as part of the conversation. Why? So glad you probably asked, because with Xbox having shot themselves in the foot, everyone's saying: ""Well now we're screwed with no options and PlayStation now holds a monopoly on the market"" and that's NOT true, that's a major problem nobody is addressing because PlayStation still has competition, they haven't taken the market because Nintendo makes consoles and games and the Nintendo Switch has sold 120 million units, the PS4 hasn't sold anywhere near that AND Gabe Newell runs Valve who is Steam so, PlayStation is competing with a bigger console, it's the PC, it's a platform so, just because Xbox falls out doesn't mean there aren't other options.

Now, the PS5 DOES still stand on its own while Xbox is absorbed into the PC, and lets face it anyway, the Xbox was always a PC and it was built for PC enthusiasts. All of the games you saw on the Xbox were former PC games so the Xbox dies, it's just going back home where it started. But, with the PS5, and even former Xbox execs have stated this, as was mentioned, Xbox games are on the PC so you don't need an Xbox. PS5, yes, they're porting games to the PC that's true, BUT, they port very slowly and PlayStation announced their Live Service Games, which may not last long as they're not exactly welcome on PlayStation platforms and are going to be run out, will see simultaneous release on PC, but single-player games, at least as of now, PC gamers are gonna have to wait so, if you can be patient, perfect, but I still wouldn't recommend it and not all games will go PC. The other thing is that PlayStation games haven't ported and translated well to the PC which is baffling because they're developed on a PC, you'd think it's just work, but it doesn't. PlayStation games are best played on the PlayStation, it's a strange phenomenon so the best experience is still on a PS console. Xbox games, they just work on a PC.

However, I'm in the market to get a PC now, or upgrade my current old out of date PC because there are some games I'll never get to play on my PS that are just PC experiences and we're always meant for PC. I don't play Fortnite, or Call of Duty, Minecraft or Roblox or any of that trendy crap, but there are games that are only on PC and that's why I try to stay semi-updated. I don't buy the best out there but I don't think I'm getting the worst either but I try not to fall too far behind. Sometimes a PC is necessary. An Xbox, isn't going to matter because like he said and then slid the Xbox next to the PC, Xbox made a lot of really bad business decisions and their management sucks and has no idea what they're doing so, they're almost dead as a hardware manufacturer now streaming games over the Amazon Firestick, they'll sink that low at this point, but PlayStation AND Nintendo, there's games you'll only ever be able to experience or will be best experienced only on their consoles",GgJj9Mok9dA,True

@Gloomshimmer,2024-07-16T15:33:13Z,0,"lol no. 2024 is the worst time to buy a console. they stuck in the past, are expensive, you also get every ""exclusive"" on PC, Gamepass also, every periphery works, consoles have no dlss,No free Shops, No vpn, you have actually working free and gsync, you can also stream Games, but not only in full hd, you can Mod, gameprices are Low, No Costs for onlineplay,  you have the biggest Game library, you have full downwards compatibility Back to the 80s without paying Money for a lazy remaster. only console which makes sense will be the Switch 2. Xbox series and ps5 is the worst Generation ever.

and PC is only expensive once, then you Upgrade. and then youre Always top notch. no ""Performance Mode in medium Details to get 40 to 60 FPS"". the only reason for consoles Back in the days where ""No cheaters"" but with Crossplay and Hardware cheats like mouse converters, its also on consoles.

PC has one con: the price. thats it. i can plug it in my TV and use IT as a console, but Games Look better, run smoother. and with dlss a 500 bucks PC from today is always better than a ass old console developed in 2018. 

all the Arguments which counted for consoles in the past like ""plug and play, Couch Coop, nice exklusives"" only work for the Switch these days...but theres a Steamdeck. where i dont have Problems with crosssave, crossbuy or overpriced remasters of the same Game every 2 months.Where are all the big titles which i need a series x or ps5 for? demons Souls? Gran turismo? Rest will be available on Windows. pile is big, i can wait and play it in ultra with 60 plus frames stable in native 4k or a real upscaler, Not Just Checkerboarding. i get real raytracing, i get really good audio without a subscription, i get real discord, i can contact customer Support direct with my systemspecs a log and so on.


2024 theres No reason for a console, except youre Low on Money. but the bucks you save, are the bucks you pay for PSN, periphery (dualsense and xsx Controller brake down after 2 years because hall effect is a myth for them) and Games. And if i want to collect retail PC Always has the best collectors with the least scalpers. also nearly all MMORPGs or arpgs drop on PC First. RTS also (OK dead genre atm). i can play Star Citizen and get Updates all the time No ""sorry we dont Support Elite or final Fantasy 14 not any longer on this Plattform, buy new"". If my frames drop i invest in a Upgrade....which console Players also have to do because Vanilla ps5 and xsx are dead and done.


theres no reason for consoles except the price at First. communities are mixed these days,discord is available everywhere and all online Games are Crossplatform. so No ""my friends are on PSN"" anymore.",GgJj9Mok9dA,True

PC:
Cons
- I work on a PC all day at work
- Regular updates be it Windows / Drivers can be game breaking
- PC faults can take lengthy amounts of time to troubleshoot
- Lacks game dashboard (I admit this is a strech but something about them, and no steams big picture doesnt count for me)
- Costly to replace when entire system is outdated.

Pros: 
-Ultrawide support
- Better graphics settings (console medium and pc medium are not the same, pc has much better details)


Console:
Pros:
-  Exclusives, sure but not too bothered.
-  pick up and play, this is the biggest one for me. Literally turn the controller on and away you go.
- Physical games to collect. 

Cons 
- lower fps, but nowadays I lean toward single player so not a deal breaker
-  lack of ultrawide support. 
- Monthly online subscription, though I already pay for gamepass because PC.",GgJj9Mok9dA,True

I can easily get a great experience targeting 60fps or better in most games on a beautiful OLED panel.

I know a game type of display could get me more, but I have no need of that. Not everyone is a fan of the high fps fast flowing games.

@someguyusa,2024-07-09T14:59:46Z,1,"There are only a few reasons to get a gaming PC over a modern console. For the games that do not exist on consoles, laptop portability, superior VR, and 60+ fps consistently with high-end gaming PCs. However, the pricing is way higher to secure a high-end gaming PC, compatibility issues can occur at any time, and typically cheating is way more prevalent on PC. Unless you're heavily into non-console games, VR, demand 60+fps, and are the kind of gamer that frequently plays through older games, replays all the games you buy, and care about preservation (most of ya'll are lying to yourselves, imo), then just get a PS5 or Xbox Series X (but PS5 is better currently, imo). Given that the majority of mainstream games players desire are sometimes exclusive to a console for at least a year, and that modern consoles are hitting 60fps, then it's the simpler, easier, and generally comparable option - especially for price. Sure, PC can do other stuff, but that's a silly point in price comparisons.

That being said, just because it is the better route in most respects, the barrier to entry is fairly steep compared to console. The financial cost is only part of the issue. The work required for instances like drivers, software installation, ""workstation"" set up,  and peripheral needs can be somewhat prohibitive for a casual game enthusiast. Consoles are a great way for someone to ""plug-n-play"" if they have no interest or ability for entering the PC market. More people playing games matters more than what type of system they are enjoying them on.

@jd3666,2024-07-04T12:45:22Z,0,"6:59 .      Ok so the whole video is this new console series x and ps5 have a launch price that does not cover the cost of the parts... the pc has to cover the cost of its parts and is potentially upgradable to 8 years (am4?),  new motherboard and cpu upgradable forever.

Pc has to cover the cost of the parts inside it.   In order to get the graphics cards inside ps5 and series x is about 6600xt level gpu. 7600xt has worse performance and is more expensive... so gpu manufacturers are not even trying for pc.

There are so mamy reasons why this is not an appropriate discusssion.

This is the real discussion: do you like playstation? Get a ps5... do you like games that are not playstation exclusive? Get a pc... shhhhh stop crying shhhhh... just get a pc, use your xbox as an emulator or a toaster or a bookend.

Its gonna be ok just get a pc... dont like drm use GOG.. want 70 free games a year through epic? What to play with your friends without monthly membership to... your pc? Want to get the platform everyone is selling to? Want any xbox only game? Get a pc and get xbox game pass for pc.

Microsoft is Microsoft. Get a series s to play every emulator up to ps3... get a pc to do anything else. 

If you like playstation you will not really get that on pc. Playstation is still its own thing despite there best attempts to ruin there own ip: Gran Turismo, God of War (sad man walking), etc etc etc, playstation was a gift from nintendo. There are two consoles now. They are made by Nintendo and the other was a console nintendo was going to make with sony after the successful integration of sony sound chips into the snes. Nintendo backed out and sony moved forward with their mostly complete and functional design... nintendo gave birth to playstation most likely because they are so greedy they wanted to torture there customers by making them use 25mb carts in a cd world.  Because nintendo refused to move outside the cartridge environment they to this day remain stuck multiple decades behind... the switch could not compete with an xbox 360. The switch cant even play n64...

Sony is also slowly dying now havijg released an entire console without anygames. Ps5 has no: Gran Turismo, God Of War, no jdm racers, no console exclusive jrpg s even. No ps5 console exclusive jrpg s... no console exclusive japanese rpg s from a Japanese console?

At this point sony has disappeared into white powder and will not be coming up for air until their movie side bankrupts them.",GgJj9Mok9dA,True

@harshilarora4025,2024-06-28T06:24:47Z,0,"Interesting video. Here’s my opinion on the take of whole PC vs Console as I have owned both at some point. In general I tend to play fps multiplayer games over single player games. I would pick a console over PC because the amount of cheating/hacking is much higher on PC than a console. Yes, there are external inputs like Zen to mod the scripts for games on console but, it isn’t game breaking like seeing through walls. Another deal breaker for me is price, console is cheaper and by the time next one comes up it will be okay for me to afford that. Maintenance is also something which is more complex on PC over console. It would be unfair to say that games aren’t well optimized on PC over console but, I still tend to experience game breaking glitches on PC more over console. 

Yes, one gets more fps and graphics on PC but, it isn’t a deal breaker for me.

In 2 generation of consoles people will spend around $1,000 for two generations of consoles. A PC gamer will spend $3,500 on the PC rig and then another $1,000 every other year for two generation to be able to play mainly PS5 games. So in 14 year (two generation) PC gamers will have spend $3,500 on the PC rig and another $6,000+ to upgrade their PC over 2 generations or 14 years.

I dont understand why computers just dont play well with a TV. You say refresh rates.. but why does the console do just fine?

Also mostly helpful but a little confusing when you say you can't really get  500 built PC that can perform as well as ps5.. you say consoles can do what a PC can... but then give examples of consoles unable to do certain PC things.. and then say PC will always look better. 

Side opinion, I think this distinction is less true than 15 yrs ago.. with genuine texture upgrade paths and true ray tracing options.. but PC makes movements smoother and lines more crisp with crazy high resolution.. but that doesn't always equal a more enjoyable image.. because the models in the game (for what I play) are designed to look good at 1080p or 4k etc... so the boosted resolution kinda highlights the lack of fidelity more pronounced like a soap opera or just tv in general when we switched from 480 signals to 1080p or 4k tv shows and now we're seeing everyones sweaty pores and can tell the lighting is fake etc.

He is the #1 Chronus Script salesman on youtube and advertises his Scripts through his channel.

Now watching some of the cheating streamers that have been called out by Call Of Shame, ItsHappa, and Badboymeaming. You can see clearly they rage hack looking through walls and legit aim lock onto bodies.

What it looks like Chronos does is move the left analog stick and pull down on the right one for you. If you are good at the game you end up doing that on your own to activate aim assist while you aim at the enemy. I dont know what it is like using a chronus, but watching people play with it its not something that worries me at all compared to wall hackers and aim bots.

I have come across way to many PC cheaters and not once have I ever complained about a player on Console. Now, keyboard and mouse with the Chronos Zen is something that is super powerful and yea I am worried about that. However, I never see any console players on keyboard and mouse that I am like damn they are impossible to kill or they are cheating.

2: They dont die as easily as you stated. I think going off the 360 red ring of death is a poor choice. For one, that was almost 20 years ago and two that really only happened in the first generation of 360s.

My Day 1 Xbox One lasted 10 years and still has plenty of life in it, I just upgraded to the Series X. I still have my OG Xbox, still have my Gamecube, still have my N64, still have my 360. My first 360 got the red ring but my Elite has never faltered.

I also love playing on a big screen TV. I currently have a Samsung Q80A TV which is capable of 120fps and all my games running at 4k look outstandingly gorgeous. I much prefer a big screen to a small monitor. Even if I can see inside the pours of Raiden its just too small an image for me to enjoy. I'm not a competitive gamer. Playing games on my TV I notice zero input lag so I don't understand the obsession with that.

A bonus nugget of info, though the Series X may be the most lackluster of the 4k gaming scene it has one feature that is absolutely incredible and unique to it and that is Quick Resume which allows up to 6 games to be kept in the very spot you left it indefinitely making switching between games seamless. You can literally stop a game with Master Chief jumping mid air, play something else, turn off your console, unplug it, come back in a year, turn on Halo and have MC land where he was falling. I literally never have to wait for company logos and main menus again. And it hinders absolutely nothing to do this.

And you know what, I have passion for consoles. When I was coming up there was plenty of passion for them. They were my childhood. This 2,000 dollar paperweight though, I have no passion for. It's been cool but ultimately too much heartache for too much money. I've had more crashes, more problems with this one 2,300 dollar machine than all my other consoles COMBINED. I am just not a fan of them. So I'm biased there but I wanted to fill you in on some plus's you excluded about consoles.",GgJj9Mok9dA,True

@WthaHatchet,2024-06-21T20:35:14Z,0,"Like you said at the end all is better. Both and all are better than just one. The thing you forget to mention is the cheapness of Xbox Games, the gigantic library of games, not all on PC. I dont really agree they are the same. Honestly Xbox PC pass is not nearly as large compared to Game Pass.  Im pretty sure they dont have the same lineup. Especially indie games. Xbox has so many indie titles on Xbox. The passion in console gaming is mostly the passion of gaming. Not a lack of passion. In my opinion a console gamer is a smart economical gamer focused on the game playing and the experience that comes with it. Getting right into games, friends all on chats with headsets working together without Discording. You didn't have that on PC first except through chat and ICQ back in the day. I think console is an easier less complicated experience.  PC is more self-expression related when it comes to the actual PC though console you can make look different but not choose your internals. They all have pluses and minuses but both are awesome and worth the price you pay for each and all.  With cross platform especially now you can't go wrong with any or all!

@Agumon5,2024-06-21T16:35:28Z,0,"Think I'm going to share a different perspective than most. I was a PC gamer primarily during the early 2000s. I actually moved from PC to console. After building many PCs, it just didn't really spark any interest in me continuing to do that. I like the simplicity of console. I like to separate my workstation, which I see as my computer, from my console which I see is my gaming device. 

Yes you can always put a PC on your TV, but something about the console experience feels better to me. Could be a mental block or something else. 

Having been somebody who really was into PC gaming and PC building during the early and mid-2000s, and then transition into consoles for the PS4 generation, I guess it puts me in a different camp than most. 

There are a lot of things I appreciate about console, although a lot of this is starting to go away. I appreciate the level playing field, but crossplay is kind of killing this. I appreciate not having to worry about mods or anything like that in games, especially MMOs, in order to be competitive or keep up with end game (console games that have console exclusive servers like ESO for example). And of course, the classic answer is it's where a lot of my friends are still playing.

From there it's been console after console up until the last console I bought which from memory was the Switch. 2019 I said no more consoles, let's try building a gaming pc. Mainly for 2 reasons. I was running out of room to store consoles, game discs and second reason I always wanted to game on a pc. 

I still have all my consoles, even my Atari. I love them, still have them hooked up and game on them depending on the games I want to play or who I'm playing them with. But predominately I'm gaming on my PC. I enjoy gaming on my PC because I can game on one screen while watching something on the other. I love gaming on my PC because the games run smoothly and look fantastic. On PC these days I can get games that were only available on console. looking to the future, I dont think I'll ever buy a console again. 
I loved gaming as a kid and still love my gaming as a 41-year-old. Don't game as much as I used to but still do make time for it.
Be it on console or PC. if you can afford both, I would recommend it. Because some days you want to game on PC either campaign story mode or online multiplayer but then there are days when you want to sit around with friends, fire up some Mario Kart tournaments starting on your SNES working your way all the way up to your Switch to see who the best of the best in Mario Kart on all generations of Nintendo console is!! lol",GgJj9Mok9dA,True

Smash Melee has less than 2ms of latency on a Gamecube with OG gamepads and a CRT display (or OLED), the difference in gameplay and how the game feels to play is massive.

Street Fighter 6 on PS5 is on average @ 92ms input response, versus less than 3ms for SF4 on PS3, PC now actually are the only way to play games with half-decent input-response times, don't get me wrong, it can actually be worse still than console, when you use frame-interpolation methods like DLSS and enable tons of ray-tracing, you can see as much as well over 150ms frame-time latency, yikes that's so bad, especially for someone that grew up with 0.1ms consoles and 180 to 360Hz PC gaming CRT monitors that can achieve perceptively 0ms latency via ultra smooth raster-scan, what is happening to vide games that the gameplay is so badly downgraded from poor latency performance, a lot of it is down to badly optimized games, many devs are just resorting to A.I. frame amping and upscaling to raise the average FPS, at the cost of actual input-fidelity that only comes with raw native frames and optimization, it seems these shortcuts are being made on console and PC versions of games alike.

I'm finding that it's the indie games and smaller dev teams that are actually putting far more effort into their code, they seem to actually care about the gameplay and input response of their games, because it directly ties into the overall gameplay experience, though there are exceptions, the new DOOM games, DOOM 2016/DOOM Eternal, both have superb optimization and input-fidelity, I can get DOOM 2016 to run @ sub 2ms on my gaming rig with Win 7 ""lite"" version of the OS, when using my Sony CDM-G520 (OLED is not bad either) and hyper-low-latency USB encoder for my Razer classic mouse and custom 16-way joystick and 8 analogue mechanical buttons (so much better than a keyboard for gaming, I get proper analogue directional input instead of just digital WASD keys, as well as main action buttons such as CRTL/SPACE/Reload/strafe/etc with multiple levels of analogue input sensitivity and much lower latency than a keyboard, everything is right there for my left hand to comfortably reach and use as needed, and it just offers a night & day improvement over a standard keyboard for gaming on a PC, I can also use a wireless version of this setup with my PlayStation move navigation joystick, which means I can do the WASD controls wirelessly and place my left arm comfortably on my lap or wherever I want whilst using the mouse with my right arm as normal, the triggers, D-Pad and buttons on the move act as the jump/reload/crouch/strafe/etc buttons, the latency isn't quite as good as the custom APEM quad-axis/16-way optical sensor industrial grade joystick (that's a mouthful), which was originally meant for controlling industrial vehicles & equipment, it has incredible input fidelity that rival some of the best laser sensors, and there are more PC games that support 16-Way navigation/movement input that you might think (especially on Steam), and even if they don't, you still have the quad-axis 8-way movement, why the keyboard side navigation input doesn't match the infinite movement of the mouse controls input I don't know.",GgJj9Mok9dA,True

@Wobble2007,2024-06-29T04:11:27Z,0,"@@kirstyanderson1641 The age-old debate: Is literacy important? As a debater, I'm excited to present a strong case for why literacy is crucial in today's society.

**Argument 1: Empowers Education**

Literacy is the foundation of education. Without the ability to read and write, one cannot access educational materials, participate in class discussions, or complete assignments. This hinders an individual's capacity to acquire knowledge, develop critical thinking skills, and achieve academic success. Literacy is a gateway to education, and without it, students are left behind.

**Argument 2: Boosts Economic Opportunities**

Literacy is a key factor in determining socio-economic status. Individuals who are literate have better job prospects, higher earning potential, and increased career advancement opportunities. A literate workforce is more productive, efficient, and competitive, contributing to economic growth and development. In contrast, illiteracy can lead to unemployment, poverty, and social exclusion.

**Argument 3: Enhances Critical Thinking and Problem-Solving**

Literacy enables individuals to process complex information, analyze arguments, and make informed decisions. It allows people to evaluate information critically, distinguish fact from fiction, and solve problems effectively. In today's information age, where misinformation abounds, literacy is essential for navigating the digital landscape and making informed choices.

**Argument 4: Fosters Cultural Understanding and Empathy**

Literacy helps individuals understand different cultures, histories, and perspectives. Reading about various experiences and viewpoints broadens one's horizons, promotes empathy, and encourages tolerance. This is particularly important in today's globalized world, where cultural understanding is vital for building bridges between communities.

**Refutation of Opposing Views**

Some may argue that literacy is not as crucial in today's digital age, with the rise of audio and visual media. However, this view overlooks the fact that literacy is still essential for accessing and understanding digital information. Moreover, literacy is a skill that complements other forms of communication, rather than replacing them.

Others may claim that literacy is only important for academics or professionals. However, this perspective neglects the fact that literacy has far-reaching benefits beyond education and employment. It enhances critical thinking, problem-solving, and cultural understanding across all aspects of life.

**Conclusion**

In conclusion, literacy is not only important but essential in today's society. It empowers education, boosts economic opportunities, enhances critical thinking and problem-solving, and fosters cultural understanding and empathy. While some may argue that literacy is outdated or only relevant to academics or professionals, I firmly believe that it remains a fundamental skill that benefits individuals and society as a whole. By promoting literacy, we can unlock the full potential of individuals and communities worldwide.",GgJj9Mok9dA,True

In regards now of 11 years of my MSI laptop, witch in 2013 was already more powerful than unreleased new console gen at the time. 
I made the jump in 2024 to a 2023 MSI GT Titan gt 77 Deal, so 10 years later model with the second best config for GPU, CPU, witch it costed me 3000€. and still waiting.

Pro console mind :
Although living close to videogame shops in Paris where is litteraly 5 shops next to each other. 
There is this kid in a candy store to search a game you're looking for, then compare the best preserved one and find the jewel and the hidden gem, that don't exist at all in PC. Also return your games to have voucher to buy another one or when you need cash just get them back and knowing it will make the happiness of it's next owner. 
with One Xbox Series X, it covers 4 generation of games, that you can find really cheap on videogame stores. Some have an increase value and they also can cost you "" nothing "" to play if you resell them.

My actual Laptop that's the only piece of hardware i'm still using in 11 years later and it costed me with inflation 2200€ in 2024 money, with added SSD's ram and repairs , i 've owned a Xbox one the second longest time ( 7 years ) bluray 3D then Ps4 for their exclusives  ( witch now is going less and less exclusives ) then Xbox Series X , PS5 and finally the Xbox series S witch totally disapointed to not run 1080p 60 fps perfect,  resell it. 

if i would rank all the gaming experiences, memories and emotional feels of the last 11 years it would be like this, price and time of buy  : 

1 2200 € new 2013 PC ( Lot of lan with my friends and on the go, Video editing,  a New Zealand travel and still able to carry my library, MGS5, Battlefront 2 , Dawn of war., upgrade and repair experiences ( replaced the GPU in 2020 and replaced the battery, 150€ and 4 years of more life from it )
2 400€ used 2015 Xbox one ( Halo coop with a friend and good exclusives like Gears and Forza ) 
3 400€ used 2022 Xbox Series X ( impressive perforance boost and the backward compatibility )
4 200€ used 2019 PS4 ( Death stranding day one, god of war and building up ps4 games i missed since the release )
5 300€ new 2021 Xbox series S ( first graphical boost since my 2013 MSI laptop ) 
6 580€ new 2022 PS5 ( excited to have... finished some PS4 game and now God of war ragnarok, but i feel it's a waste for now even it's the console to play... PS4 and PS3 remastered or stand alone game, never actually played a standalone PS5 in about two years of ownership ) 

so my oldest gear, alongside one of the worst console ever existed, xbox one, are on my favorite, not because of hardware only but the memories and the game than came along. 

rank of all time best memories : 
- Xbox
- Xbox 360
- PS2

choose them all or at least keep the plateform that will do your solo and with friends journey. Everything else is bonus, like now i own a PS2, PS3 and PS vita and the PS vita is my favourite device of Sony and handled with so many PSP, PS vita and Playstation classic a PS2 remastered and PS3 Alike graphics with 0 noise, lightweight and sturdy design.

To summerize if i have two choice to keep for all my consoles it would be : 
- Desktop Replace Gaming Laptop PC
- PS Vita

one choice only :
- Desktop Replace Gaming Laptop PC",GgJj9Mok9dA,True

@ramspaypal6052,2024-06-17T05:31:04Z,2,"Consoles last longer than pc.
Hd 7850 outperformed ps4 at launch, but noe new games like ac Valhalla dont even open on that gpu 

Consoles have pre compiled shaders which is just not possible on pc. Precompiled shaders improve load times, give a stutter free gameplay experience and are not taxing on the cpu, which improves performance.

Consoles have unified memory, much better optimization in ways not possible on pc(for example, cod modern warfare 3 on old gen consoles use software based variable rate shading which is just not there on pc, heavily optimised on consoles, again, a hd 7850 gpu doesn't even come near to that performance) 

Consoles are hasslefree, besides the usual cons of pc regarding troubleshooting etc...even the expensive PC's need a proper setup of every game to get a playable smooth experience. What do i mean by that? You need to adjust graphics settings to makesure you're always above a target framerate, use rtss to cap that frametimes, and use the appropriate vsync option through nvidia profile inspector according to the displays refreshrate, to have a playable smooth experience. And this is something you have to do for every game, no matter what pc you use. 
Consoles are setup out of the box. 
When you play spiderman on ps5 at quality mode, ps5 uses a 33.333ms cap, and a 1/4 vsync on a 120hz display, a 1/2 vsync on a 60hz display and a 3/4 vsync on a 144 hz display, respectively.

Now if your MB dies ect. and you just need to replace that part your good.

Biggest console con for me is keyboard and mouse are not really supported to my knowledge, rarely play on them.

But still bought them. 


Cuz I wanted to always test them next to each other. Xbox and Playstation and I always did. Xbox was fun. I just didn't like the controller. It started off to be too bulky. I always bought the mini controllers...

Anyways PlayStation 5 is sweet. I've been beating it up for 4 years. The only thing that goes out is the joysticks on call of duty. I get a lot of stick drift. I've gone through seven controllers. I get my warranty through GameStop and I noticed the GameStop controller actually lasts a lot longer. I don't. I believe they take care of their shipping stuff.   


Every controller I bought through Fred Meyers or Target has failed within 2 to 3 months. 


I would get stick drift on call of duty..

The stick drift would get pretty bad sometimes.. 

I never throw or drop my controllers and I didn't have tile. I have  carpet.

Console still has is place but lets be real immagine habing the convinence of a nintendo switch with a handheld pc.. grab your lenovo legion go do your daily stuff and play on the go.. come home and dock it to play on the big screen and for serious gaming go chill at your pc.. or even better dock yoir hsndheld there snd use that with your chosen periferals.

Yea some games come out later on PC but if you’re that much of a nerd you can’t wait a few months or even a year for a game that’s just kind of sad. Consoles have system requirements.

@LrgPicture,2024-06-11T08:53:55Z,0,"Good video. I know it was hard with you being more of a pc guy. 

It’s amazing how some people get so competitive between pc vs console. Use what you prefer without bashing the other. Is that possible? 

Personally i prefer console. 
1. There’s really no need to upgrade a console. All games for that console are optimized for that console and thus will play perfectly without needing to “tinker” or adjust anything. 
2. I like being able to play console games when they release. I don’t want to wait until they’ve been ported over to my pc months or years later (the last of us 2 as mentioned). 
3. My PS5 is (inconspicuously) connected to my 75 inch tv. Talk about experience. I know you can get larger screened monitors but the ease of set up is perfect. When I’m done with a tv show or a movie I just press a button, grab my controller and boom I’m “in the game”. 
4. Consoles get new release when they drop. So of course they will be more expensive than getting those same games months or years later. Pc games get the discounts for “older” games and that makes sense… because the games are old(er). 
5. I’ve only had to replace my console once. It was new. It was over heating for some reason. I had the warranty from the place I bought it from. Exchanged it for a new one. Was back home gaming in less than an hr. Having to “troubleshoot” a pc issue can be a mammoth headache. Take a lot of time and money pending the issue. It’s very niche driven. If you like tinkering then you may not see a problem with this. But I’ve had computers all my life and fixed them when they break. I know how frustrating troubleshooting and fixing a pc can be. 
6. If you spend $1500 on a pc (as mentioned) and it lasts 15 yrs and I spend $500 on a console and “upgrade” every 5 yrs… in 15 yrs wouldn’t we have spent the same amount of money??? And I still get the new releases when they come out and when I upgrade. 
7. I don’t want my game play to be interrupted by notifications of any kind. I want gaming to be a completely separate experience from where I work and go to school. If I need to do something else in the moment (email, google or whatever) I have my phone. 

The thing is I can literally do this all day. It’s easy to come up with at least 50 reasons why a console is way better than a pc (or vice versa). But it honestly doesn’t matter. Use wtf you want to use. Go with what makes ya happy and don’t worry about the rest. You’re only going to waste a bunch of time on the internet in a comment section spewing a bunch of facts that really no one cares about but you. Like I just did. Peace ✌️",GgJj9Mok9dA,True

@TheRCBuildersPost,2024-06-04T07:39:29Z,1,"PC is obviously going to be better for gaming because of the ability to build and expand hardware. I've never owned a gaming PC or even played a single game on PC outside of minesweeper in middle school. That being said, consoles are just easier for those of us who do not have a clue about building a PC. Yes, you can buy a pre built, but I feel like that's going to be hit or miss when it comes to competing with the price of a next gen console. However, I feel like the gaming industry is going to eventually wipe out consoles all together anyways. They have already made online playing pretty much unbearable on consoles with cross platform due to computer mods. I recently got a series x to get back into gaming after not owning anything since the 360. I was reading the reviews for COD and it literally had a 1 star rating and review after review talking about the cross platform making it unplayable due to mods. I figured it was an exaggeration and bought it anyways. Boy, I should have listened to the reviews lol. Every game I have bought or played that is cross platform is a mess.

@SoeYanPaing,2024-06-03T12:58:19Z,0,"I have all the gaming platforms and I prefer console the most now.
Don't get me wrong. I like PC gaming. I used to be a dedicated PC gamer, primarily playing story-driven games. Because of this, I mostly used a controller. However, nowadays, as I am getting older, I lean towards consoles for their simplicity and convenience. It’s really disappointing that some console games still look and play poorly. For example, the Arkham Trilogy Remastered should have been a 60fps game—I played those on PC at a solid 60fps years ago.

On the topic of PCs, I don’t personally enjoy mods. I know I don’t need to use them, but to me, they can ruin the aesthetic and artistic choices of the developers. I prefer to enjoy the game as it was intended. I even turn off the FPS counter on my PC and only choose preset settings; I don’t like tweaking each setting to squeeze out extra performance. A stable 30fps or above is fine for me, depending on the game. I connect my PC to my TV and set it to open Steam Big Picture automatically to make it feel like a console, but it’s still not quite the same.

Although I used to play PC games at a desk, I don’t enjoy that anymore. I prefer to connect my PC to a TV and play it like a console.

I truly wish PCs had their own gaming front-end like consoles, with features like pausing, rest mode, and easy access to games. As we get older, we don’t have time for everything, and there are very few games we can play in a month.

I think there are some gamers who want a PC only for gaming and don’t really care too much about performance, but value the Steam library. I wish Valve would make a successor to the Steam Machine with mid to high-end performance. That’s a wish for some PC gamers, I think.

By the way, the Steam Deck is fantastic. I am using it as my PC gaming replacement for now.",GgJj9Mok9dA,True

If you enjoy sports titles at all then you will want to have a console.

It's insane and dont have sense pay any single player game.. camon..
Only multi-player games maybe and i say maybe worth the money.
We live in time of early access or eternal beta.. sow i dont wanna spend money for half product.. 
Before i need to try it, play and then maybe and i say maybe buy it. I i really like it.

Example: i play at 100 games this year but i pay maybe 15.

I like pc its multitasking you can install mods, or fix it you need.

I like it, but on console you can just push it on and start the game.. cant modify settings or install mods or fix or i dont know language  translations if need, or maybe  wanna change audio language  or add language i want if game not support it.

Im old gen bor in 1987 i see born gane industry. I start to play at 6/7 years old.
First was : Famicon (Dandy)
Then Sega mega drive
Then playstation (in that period have pc for a couple years was with windows millenium lol hehe .
Then Xbox❤
Then xbox 360 and in that moment i buy pc was hp pc buyed at the shop 😊with 4650

Final Fantasy 16 and Forspoken are 720p native resolution and upscaled to 1080p, and even with this they can't hit 60 fps. can you play a Skyrim modlist with 3600+++ mods on consoles? no. so no, it's not time to ditch PC, and this time will never come cause PC will be ahead of consoles cause consoles have to be cost efficient and not cost $1,500+, so the gpu that can be put on consoles will not be equal to 4080, 4090, etc. gpu on console will be a low mid tier gpu of a previous gen gpu from current gen gpu cause when the console is made new gpu's come out so consoles stay behind, so there's no need to ditch the PC.",GgJj9Mok9dA,True

To me the real selling point for PC shouldn't be the better experience in games. It should be about the EXTRA or NEW things that you can do. I wasn't that hyped about 1440p ultra 144 fps on RDR2. What I have really enjoyed is the game modding, customization and games from independent dev teams that are only on PC. If you want to try these new things then get a PC.

Console games are usually produced with a field of view which is extremely limited as developers work within the limitations of the hardware. So you can get, 60 degrees or even lower. Which for me creates motion sickness and headaches. Years ago, I read some University in UK was starting to research this and there was speculation about long term health concerns for some percentage of population. I never did see any follow up to it. But for me it is just not sustainable. I have 20 20 vision etc  but apparently sensitivity is present in something like 20 % of people. But even outside of this, it just kills immersion for me and feels like I am watching through a letterbox. I like to play at 95% or higher. But c9nsoles had to make a compromise of the amount of viewable action on screen at one time and doing it with a framerate people will accept.

@ipsnagi9442,2024-05-19T06:16:28Z,0,"I would choose PC because consoles have such limited libraries and I just don't care for online play. 5 reasons, if I had to pick, would be:
1. Emulation for almost all the old consoles (I have some of the old consoles but hooking them up takes ages and many of the dvds/media no longer run). I prefer the older games anyway and graphics and online play are non-factors to me. My internet sucks too.
2. Multitasking.
3. Customisable, even though I could do without the RGB crap and just focus on functionality.
4. Super easy to expand storage, I still haven't switched to SSDs because they're still quite expensive in my country and I don't think I'll be making the switch just yet.
5. I regret buying all my consoles except the PS2. None of the others were worth the investment now that I have the benefit of hindsight. And I am still using my 10 years old PC having just upgraded the GPU a couple of years back.

In case it wasn't clear from the above points, I'm rather poor and the consoles I bought put a significant financial strain on either myself or my parents depending on the time they were bought. I wish I really didn't bother with them at all except, of course, the PS2 (and maybe the PS1 as well).

PS. My PC is running rather hot these days (80-90 C while gaming), doesn't help that we're having a massive heatwave but I changed the gel on the processor (i7 4790k, no OC) last year and even got a decent budget cabinet (or at least I hope so). My GPU runs cool (2060 super) at around 60 C even at high graphics, though I mostly play old games (>5 years). What should I do to deal with the heat, or is there nothing to be done because of the age of the processor? If anyone can help me, it'll be greatly appreciated.",GgJj9Mok9dA,True

I checked my Task Manager and everything, CPU, Memory, Disk and GPU are all showing 100% usage. This is the thing that console gamers fear, and with good reason. My PC has not been the same since, games that I played before on much higher settings, are topping out at 30fps on low/medium and I'm currently looking to build new PC.

Both PCMR and console fanboys need to realise that not every use case is the same, and that means that a PC or a console, isn't going to be the best option for everyone.

The value proposition with a pc is that you can play games with the highest possible fidelity, and in an ideal world there would be very few problems between building the pc and enjoying the things the pc can do.

However, with my increasingly limited time and money pcs are becoming less and less practical (both in price and complexity). I’d rather just have a fixed configuration that allows me to play my games good enough. So I’ve been exclusively using my steam deck and letting my pc collect dust for about 18+ months now.

People try to act like this stuff takes a genius to figure out but your pc does most of this itself. You RARELY have to do any searching for drivers\updates.

PC is just as convenient as Console all I have to do is press Space bar and within seconds im ready to start up my game, same as pressing the power button on console and scrolling through ur games till you find one to play.

No Subscription fees on 90% of the games out there ( the games I buy will always be mine and not locked behind a game pass subscription)

Bigger maps, more freedom in games ( if its designed for PC and not Console, honestly Consoles just hold back the potential some games could have...its a shame)

Steam has the best return policy

I can play ALL my games at ANY time without having to pull out my dusty old console which will probably break at some point to which you will be having to fix\ or buy another outdated console to play those old games.

Game Library is far more vast than consoles combined.

Mods, Workstation

M&K superior to Controller in terms of accuracy

PC can be played on ur TV just like Console. (couch friendly)

@luisantoniob.1044,2024-05-10T00:29:09Z,0,"It amazes me that nobody ever talks about this. But one of the major upsides to being a console gamer is not having to deal with the uneven playing field that is the PC side of Gaming.

On the console side, everybody is running the same hardware generally.  So there is less advantage to any one player.  On the PC side, good luck playing FPSs on your $1500 pre-built against people running 5 and 10k computer setups with insane refresh speeds.

The PC side is extremely elitist. PCMR anyone? It's hard to brag about how expensive and extreme your setup is when everybody's setup is $500.00. The console side at least has an image of evenness and fairness. That image might be a mirage, but at least you can see it.

I'm not saying that the console playing field is perfectly level. There's always little hacks and glitches in games that can help people get ahead. But it's way more even and flat of a playing field than the PC side where rich assholes can just buy FPS, buy refresh rate. Buy mods that help them cheat and beat the regular players that can't afford it. Hell...the monitors on the PC side are more expensive than the computers. And can give you insane Advantage when it comes to FPS type games. I would never play PVP on a computer... that's just asking to be hacked on. Why would any real gamer want to be involved in that nonsense?

I'm not a PC hater. But using a PC for gaming is like using your everyday commuter car to go to a racetrack and race rich people in their Ferraris and Porsches and shit. Yea... good luck with that. And if your car breaks, good luck getting to work. These rich assholes can break Ferraris all day no problem.

 In this analogy, if my Xbox breaks, I just buy a new Xbox. Anybody with a basic job can just buy a new Xbox. But if a 1500 to $3,000 computer breaks and you can't easily fix it... you're fucked. And good luck easily replacing that on a regular person's salary with bills, kids, mortgages and shit. 

We console Gamers have to eat shit constantly. We're always behind PC in updates and dlcs. The cool Cutting Edge games almost always come out on PC first. But I haven't had to deal with incompatibility issues since the 90s. Nor have I ever had my Xbox hacked Or virused in some way.

Lastly in my opinion anyone who plays competitive FPS type games with a mouse is usually trash with a controller. Where the opposite is usually true the other way around. It might take a minute to get used to the movement on keyboard, but a mouse is cheating when it comes to shooting. With a controller you have to coordinate both left and right thumb with your trigger finger at the same time. It's more skill-based.

So I leave you to play in your PC side fantasy world where somehow the PC is a better gaming platform. PCS are for creating video games, consoles are so you can play those games fairly.

Thank you for the years of entertainment and knowledge. I've never been able to afford my own gaming PC. But between you and Linus Tech tips I could probably build one blindfolded. Not everybody's rich and can afford good gaming PCs. So we stick to consoles. Doesn't make PCs better just... different. and if you think it does make you better, then you are part of the PC Master race, and your Elitism is showing.

Not only did the Xbox look better, the controller is better ergonomically and you get a much better experience on Xbox live, especially with game pass, then you do on PSN.

@1403coltsfan,2024-05-07T20:26:47Z,347,"Honestly, to provide a bit of contrast to this comment section, let me speak as someone who built a $3,500 PC back in 2021 and just bought an Xbox series X for $330 during their winter sale last year. PC setup was over $5,000 if you include the two monitors, desk, and chair. I put a 3080ti and ryzen 7 5900x in my rig. For me personally, I love my gaming PC. But when you can get a console that plays games at 120 fps for $350-$550 it truly does make a PC a very hard sell. The current generation of consoles competes so well with a nice PC for such a fraction of the cost that it’s honestly astounding. Pair it with a a 120-144 refresh rate monitor and you can rarely and barely tell the difference between my pc and the series x. Also, while tinkering is a plus when it’s fun. Having to diagnose and tweak settings to figure out why a game is running like crap on my $3,500 PC is not fun at all. It’s annoying and irritating as hell when I just wanna play the damn game. Not sift through settings menus and check temps etc. I turn on the Xbox, I boot up a game, the game plays perfectly. Every. Single. Time. The consistency of that is truly valuable and I would argue a big con to PC gaming. I love both. But honestly speaking, I’d rather just buy a series x or PS5, pair it with a gaming monitor then get a $300-$400 laptop for work if I were buying again today.",GgJj9Mok9dA,True

I also ended up buying an Xbox Series X, I was instantly happy with my decision, never had any problems again. Console is just SO MUCH BETTER in that regard, all you have to do is turn it on and play, you don’t have to change any settings, on 95% of the games you pretty much have a locked 60fps, and 120 in competitive games, which in my opinion is more than enough. My favorite things about consoles are:
-Having no problems when playing games and not having to tweak settings
-Having all your games at one place and not having 10 different launchers like pc does 😂
-Price to performance

I ended up spending around £800 to build what I'd consider a decent entry level computer that is about the max of my budget.
Specs: B550 Tomahawk Max Wi-Fi, AMD Ryzen 5 5600X , Asus 3060 12gb v2 GPU, 64gb Corsair Ballistix ram, Corsair Capellix AIO, WD Black 1tb M.2, 2tb Kingston SSD  all in a Cooler master Qube 500.

I didn't build it to compete with my consoles but actually because I needed a computer to work from (creative graphic design light video editing etc) as the equivalent Mac book pro would have cost me around £3k. But I did consider gaming whilst building and it really does open up a lot more options for gaming as basically all games end up on PC eventually nowadays id say its definitely the better investment than a console long-term especially if its going to pull double duty for work too.

@draganarrow,2024-05-06T22:09:58Z,0,"I own multiple PCs, an Xbox One, and an Xbox series X.  The Xboxes are basically media players for TVs. Now that the kids have moved out, they don't get used for much else. We like using the Xbox so that we don't have to connect our smart TVs to the internet and have everything we do tracked and sold. I often am using my PC while using the TV (ADHD multitasking), so don't want my PC tied to the TV. The Xbox One has certainly lasted, and I don't regret buying it. With the changes in Microsoft/Xbox, it probably would have been better to buy a PS5 rather than the Xbox Series X, but hindsight. That being said, I would never give up my PC.

Built my first PC back when Windows ME was constantly bluescreening. AMD CPUs were SO inexpensive that I could afford to build a decent PC. I was hooked forever. So what are my major reasons for preferring a PC?
1. Versatility and convenience. Sometimes, I pull up YouTube on the TV and am instantly hit with a barrage of ads. I never see advertising on my PC. Same with watching stuff like FreeVee.  I can use my browser of choice, putting everything into containers and limiting people's access to my data. (Not doing anything questionable, just don't want to give away data). I can do spreadsheets, game dev, art, photography - anything I want - on my PC. I can use a keyboard and mouse.
2. Ability to upgrade.  Just hit the ceiling on my old AM4 motherboard. Got a Ryzen 9 5900x on sale, put in an RTX 4070 (also on sale), and upgraded the RAM. No, it's not the top gaming PC, but it's pretty sweet.
3. I don't mind waiting for games to port to PC. I don't need the latest, greatest games immediately. 
4. I'm a creature of habit. I got my first computer in 1985. 
5. Most importantly, I LOVE building PCs. My first build was Windows 95. I love learning how everything works, what is new, what is becoming obsolete. My latest build had an AIO, something I had never done. I hope to someday build a full water-cooled rig, just for the beauty of it. The changes in storage are mind boggling and delightful. I have an MSI mobo with three M.2 slots. Who would have guessed that was possible when I built that '95 PC? I wish I had more excuses to keep building.

@Jedi_Judo19,2024-05-06T09:23:53Z,1,"There are way more pros for PC gamers than console players

What are the pros and cons for consoles?

Pros:
1. Easy to set up and game (PC was actually easier for me, I just had to unzip a file, and install the game, set up my controller and play - Don't need to sign into an account and get an OTP to sign in, what a headache!!)
2. Cheaper (There are PC builds you can do that are cheaper than the current generation of consoles, and runs at the same if not better specs than the consoles. Also in the long run, PCs are cheapers as you can replace or upgrade parts instead of buying a whole new console. Let's do the math for 3 generations of consoles PS3/4/5 = My PS3 in 2012 cost $500, My PS4 from China cost $400, a PS5 currently costs $700, that's a total of $1600 over 12 years of gaming. If I had bought a PC for that price, it would've cost me less in games and probably less in hardware as well. PCs last longer than consoles as well)
3. Game exclusives (These ""exclusives"" like The Last of Us are coming to PC in a few years, so how are they exclusives? Also we can buy those games as discs and load them into PC emulators!)
4. More comfortable (Console players say it's more comfortable to just game on the coach and play - again you can do this same thing with a PC)
5. Better ports (The ports to PC usually have some glitches and are harder to run games when they first come out, but if you have the same problems on console there's very few ways to fix it other than wait for a patch, whereas PC you could tinker with the settings to get it to play. Also sometimes both PC and consoles have glitches for both with the same game)

Cons:
1. Everything listed above
2. Console companies are ripping off users with game prices and monthly subscriptions
3. Paying to play online
4. Can't do much outside of playing games and watching social media (YouTube/Netflix)
5. It's harder to stream on console than PC (on console it's easy to start streaming, but you can't interact with your stream in comments or manage the channel while streaming. Also on PC you can stream to multiple platforms simaltaneously!)

What are the pros and cons for PC?

Pros:
1. Customization (Can customize the hardware/software/game specs and games in so many ways on PC. Game mods, replacing/upgrading hardware, the whole internet is available for downloading drivers for PC, can customize game specs in so many ways, and usually the PC outperforms it's console counterpart)
2. Games (I can play every game from every console on PC, whereas most console systems don't have backwards compatibility for most of their older games. Games are much cheaper on PC even free!)
3. All the other things you can do with a PC (I can do video editing/chat with friends in various different apps/play music while gaming/create computer programing and my own video games for every generation of console - all video games today, including console games were created using a desktop computer/Use all the variety of apps that are available on the OS and MS app stores)
4. Run multiple programs simaltaneously (I can run the game plus whatever other app I want in the background - like OBS or Spotify)
5. Better performance and community (I can upscale a game on PC to 8k, 1440p, 120 fps, making it an infinitely better gaming experience. It just seems there is bigger communities of people on PC, and therefore more chances to make friends. On PS I've only made 5 friends in 6 years of gaming!)

Cons:
1. Expensive (it's actually cheaper in the long run if you think about it. See my pros column for consoles where I illustrate this point).
2. Hard to understand how to setup (This might be a bit tricky to start up and educate oneself on, but once you know it, it's like riding a bike, you'll always be able to do it!)
3. It's a bit of a jump switching to mouse and keyboard vs controller (Again though you don't have to do this, as you can use any console controller from every generation of consoles on PC. I'm playing on my laptop with my PS4 controller)
4. FMO (You might be missing out on gaming with friends on console, but just tell them to move to PC and liberate themselves! Also again I made barely any friends while playing PS, I think PS is a more single person experience as opposed to PC)
5. Hardware compatibility and Volatility in the market (The hardware market for PC parts is volatile, and hardware companies that are currently making PC parts not be in the market in the near future. Also the parts that you are upgrade sometimes will require you to upgrade multiple parts of a PC system, even having to replace the entire system).

These are just some of the reasons for me wanting to get into PC gaming over PS. Also right now is great time to get a gaming PC, as there is a bit of overproduction for parts and fewer PC gamers upgrading there PCs!",GgJj9Mok9dA,True

@user-ew5fr5bg8t,2024-05-03T12:59:47Z,0,"I'd say one of the major benefits to having a computer is an upgrade path. Yeah sure initially a computer can be slightly more expensive than a xbox.  But you're also getting more than a console you're getting something that you can do alot more than any console can do.
Basically you can use the same case the same power supply in some cases the same ram. All you really have to do to upgrade a computer is replace the motherboard the processor. And you don't have to do all of this at the same time. Being able to buy your parts individually can allow you to use high end components because you only have to buy one or two components at a time. Generally when I'm building a new computer one month I may by the processor and motherboard then the next month the nvme storage and the ram then the case and the power supply. This means I won't have to take a hard hit to the wallet all at once. It's easier for me because I'm computer savvy and have built computers for the last 20 years. I can see this being a problem for someone freshly coming over from console. I can also see how being able to save that money doing the work yourself isn't something they'll be able to do. With all brand new parts I can make an 8 liter computer that can outperform an Xbox for $750.  ASRock DESKMEET X300 Mini PC Barebone System AMD X300  with a MSI Ventus GeForce RTX 4060 Ti would work. You could also go super cheap and just buy a used office computer and sling a decent graphics card in it. Both of these have the potential to outperform the newest Xbox.",GgJj9Mok9dA,True

That is where having a PC really makes a lot of sense. I bought the Xbox series X because I was accustomed to buying an Xbox. But it is the last console I will purchase, except for Nintendo. Another reason to have a PC is that there is a vast library of retro PC titles available that can still play on Windows or even in DosBox that make a PC a great value.

@KirkEn-vl6kf,2024-04-27T18:04:57Z,0,"Top 5 reasons for PC:

1. Lots of selections of games from various digital gaming platforms (Steam, GoG, etc.) that run on various OS (Linux, Mac, Windows.)
2. Run old games (wine, dosbox, emulators)
4. Easy upgrade of components, can last a decade or more (especially if you use Linux)
5. Can do many other stuff besides gaming (work, home, hobby, social, etc.)

One thing I'd like to add: Gaming is not just for fast-paced high-resolution FPS RPG multi-player kind. There is a large segment of players for casual gaming, and Smartphones beat any PC or gaming console. Then there are portable gaming PCs like Steam Deck, where you can continue playing the same games on the go.",GgJj9Mok9dA,True

@samnil8025,2024-04-27T12:55:04Z,1,PC is always better. You have lot of more choices (pc spec hardware and software and where to buy games) and also most games can only be modded on pc. Also most multiplayer game on pc don NOT require a paid subscription to be able to play online. Like on Playstation and Xbox where you HAVE (for most games) TO PAY subscription service to be able to play online. Most game saves are better to manager on pc. PS5 games save data can only now be sync to paid cloud save or backup to usb storage over ps5 full system backup settings. And it takes long time. We use to be able to move save game data on to a usb storage for ps4 games but on ps5 games its a no no.

@rickardsvensson7097,2024-04-24T11:25:50Z,0,"I am a devoted PC guy.
But I can see the issues and goods with both sides overall.

The main reasons why I dont use a console is mainly because I want the freedom to play 99.9% of the games thats out there.
I also want the freedom to make the device personal.

I also dont see a reason to have a console when there is stuff like Steam Big picture mode. If you hook up a TV to the PC aswell, you have basiclly a amazing console and PC at the same time. With a game libary thats so much better.

Sure, I did pay roughly 2500-3000 bucks for my PC. Wich is significent more than a PS5 or xbox. But when we concider that I get basiclly all 3 in the same device its not that bad of a price to pay.

An other thing that makes me dislike PS5 and Xbox is that I have to pay a monthly fee to even play the games online that I pay 50+ dollar for. If I have both PS5 and Xbox I am looking at a 1000 buy in on consoles and then 110 bucks (games normally between 50-60 so going middle) and then on top of that 20-25 dollar for internet/online access.
In 1 year for just these 2 consoles, 1 game to each and the online access, we are talking closer to 1500 dollars there, wich is the price of a PC that can do the exact same thing, for longer. A great PC can be had for 1000 bucks that will run any game if resolution is lowered a little.

However, the main reason I see that makes PC real bad, is the fact that its so easy to cheat on it.
Cheaters are everywhere in basiclly any game thats online.
Im sure many have heard of the issues CS2 for exampel faces at this moment.

Other things that makes PC somewhat worse is that many games are spread out on diffrent plattforms.
Its not only Steam. Plattforms like Origin, Epic games, EA Play and so on is needed to get the full 100% coverage. But, majority is still free to use. If its your first PC and you wanna play a lot of games at once though, look at what have the most of the games you wanna play and look in to subscriptions there.
Many of them do have a monthly fee that makes it possible to play most of, if not all of the games for free while having this sub. Have it for a couple of months and test the game you want and from there decide wich ones you actually wanna buy.
However, I would always recommend Steam alone since they have the vast majority. But we cant hide from the exclusivity. 

I also very much dislike about PC is that it can get so dang expensive.
Now, most things is not necessary. You can get away with a 1000 dollar PC, 100 dollar monitor, 60 dollar mouse and keyboard combo along with a 50 dollar headset.
Roughly 1200 for everything, all in. Not crazy if you think of it.
BUT! There is things thats so much better and so many things to get invested and fall inlove with, both good and bad honestly.
To make an exampel for myself, I love to make everything look perfect. In other words, I hate having kabels visable as an exampel.
Because of this, I did spend money on a XLR mic with necessary equipment. Ive spent money on arms for mic and monitor. Ive spent money on an adjustable table. Tools to drill and a lot more.
Just for me to make my desk look perfect and hide everything I dont wanna see, Ive spent way over 1000 bucks just there. Its getting close to 2000 dollars at this moment.

While a PS5 or Xbox I could just lay down flat and drill a hole or 2 and everything is hidden. Perfect. Less money, less problems.


In the end however, unless there is a game thats only realeased on PS5 or Xbox and I can not wait to play it, I will stick to PC. Despite it being expensive and sometimes time consuming. I do love it.
But I would never recommend anyone to get into PC unless they have the money to actually spend on the PC itself and the possible hobby they will find because of it. Everyone do find something.
A console is a great alternative to those who do not have the funds, time or energy to have a PC.
But I would always recommend someone to give both sides a try and see what they like the most and start there. Can always buy more later.",GgJj9Mok9dA,True
@snakeplissken111,2024-04-24T11:20:01Z,0,"By the way: Tech Channels adjusting historical GPUs prices for inflation are doing company PR work for free. 

They're making current GPU prices look better than they are. They're also promoting the idea that GPU makers have been proposing since: ""Sinking prices are a story of the past!"" ""The more you buy, the more you save!"" Basically, the idea that progress was cancelled. Meanwhile, for the same Dollars that could buy you a Phenom II in 2009 or an Athlon 64 in 2004, you can still get a current gen Ryzen in 2024.

That's progress, baby: Being able to offer better technology at roughly stable or even reduced prices (screens, storage, memory, 4K TVs, you name it). If everybody would have axed that early, Tech Channels would have no audience they could reach out to: (Gaming) PCs would have never climbed out of a rather exclusive niche, if exist at all. Either that, or they'd be the world's biggest IQ test by now, considering the market price of consoles. 

You have to remember that 1980s and 1990s PC and home computer powerhorse genres (simulators, adventure games, complex RPGs, strategy games) are now only played by a niche on PC as well. Mainstream PC gamers largely play the exact same games as mainstream console gamers now. And most major releases are multiplatform to boot, with consoles being the lead design platform.

@AAAA-lt9hq,2024-04-23T23:02:11Z,0,"IMO, if you already have a powerful PC, the only reason to own a console is for console/platform-exclusive content.

Nintendo seems to be the only console manufacturer/developer that still insists on hardware exclusivity for its first party content. This makes sense because it is how Nintendo leverages the value of its storied intellectual property.

That said, Nintendo stopped trying to build the most powerful console possible back in the 90s. 

Nintendo now focuses on unique and innovative gameplay experiences facilitated by well-designed games and cleverly designed hardware that is often only modestly powerful. 

Its games are also largely targeted toward children, making Nintendo consoles and games more akin to toys than the more adult-oriented experiences offered by the PC, XBox, and PlayStation.

It seems that Microsoft and Sony are gradually going the route of Sega by gradually transitioning out of the hardware business. 

Microsoft and Sony now seem to be focusing on cross-compatible game development and publishing via streaming and game subscription services.

That said, there should always be a place for physical media because fast Internet access is not universal across the United States. Yet, developers and streaming services seem to take fast Internet speeds for granted.

Additionally, consoles were much more reasonably priced when they did not require so many accessories and additional external storage on which to save games and, increasingly, to store the games themselves. 

We have now become almost entirely dependent upon fast, reliable Internet connectivity to do everything. We are almost as dependent upon the Internet as we are electricity.

I would rather have a game on a flash drive or optical media than to constantly be purchasing additional hard drive space or revisions of a console. 

These mid generation upgrades were much rarer in the past and, because there was no Internet and technical support was slow, consoles and games had to be robust, long-lasting, and free of technical issues.

With the exception of my NES (we all remember the white screen cartridge connector problem with that console and the widely circulated myth of blowing inside the cartridge to fix it), most of my old cartridge based consoles were rock solid and still work fine decades later. And they don't require (much) external storage.",GgJj9Mok9dA,True
@Darches,2024-04-23T22:33:16Z,0,"$1500 starting cost for PC? I disagree. I've been doing _everything_ on my $1000 prebuilt laptop (Helios 300) for the last 6+ years and have not once considered upgrading it. The only console that's even worth considering is the Nintendo Switch due to its many desirable exclusives, but that's only after buying a strong PC.

The PC may look more expensive up front but that simply isn't true. The PC includes almost every past console, but no console includes the PC. Nobody buys a console without also having some kind of weak PC to go with it. You said it yourself, writing an email on console is pure pain. It's far better to combine those costs and get hardware worth keeping. Also, being able to upgrade storage on a console is NOT a pro because it's universal. Even my laptop has that option, although I'm still happy with the 237 GB SSD + 931 GB HDD starting storage. And don't even get me started on the price of games. My Steam library would've cost me thousands on console, not to mention all the missing exclusives and indie titles I love. I even forgot about bonus fees to play online. Or when I booted my Xbox 360 I was bombarded with tiled ads. It's absurd. And the load times, dear god [ranting]

I grew up with consoles and I love Nintendo games but I would never be so naïve as to think that consoles are even remotely comparable to PC. PC crushes console every day of the week no matter how much you spend.

If you want to gift a Switch to a 6 year old, that's a different story. If you're buying for yourself, PC all the way.

It's a hopeless depression - except it's not actually hopeless, it just feels like it when you're lost and confused and reading a bunch of troubleshooting crap has you flustered.

(the BEST thing to do when this happens is step away.  I have gotten so frustrated - and the last thing you want to do, is be playing with small electronics when you're frustrated.  It's a bad recipe, and odds are you aren't going to make sense of any instructions while you're flustered anyway.  It's fruitless.

@VeggyZ,2024-04-23T15:56:29Z,0,"Yeah... I'll pass on ditching the PC thingy tho, thanks...

I've been a strictly PC gamer since about 2012, and I've never once considered playing any of the games I own on PC, on a console.  That said, the last console I owned (aside from a switch, which family bought me as a generous gift a couple years ago) was the Xbox 360!  

Even if I had those newer consoles, I would opt for the PC version 100% of the time - even with a crappy port, the PC version still usually looks and plays nicer - but I guess my hardware is high end, and has been for most of that time since 2012 (ok, so my i7 5930K wasn't ""high end"" ...but it's still more than sufficient for any gaming application minus 2 or 3, like X4 Foundations.) so even most train wrecks run pretty damn well, with a tweak or two... 

...and by the way that i7 5930K is now running just peachy in my old gaming PC I fixed up for cheap and gave to my friend/boss - 10+ years down the road, she's still able to play almost any game maxed out and modded and whatever else have ya - though, my friend DID get a good deal on my old video card (free). 

...and with older games, PC gaming is better still.  Playing an old game with enhanced graphical features enabled via the control panel, or nvidia profile inspector, and using DSR upscaling, can be a massive improvement.  Massive.  No comparison massive - games almost look modded level improvement, and usually don't require anything but  a setting change here and there.

I won't be turning back, haha. It isn't stubbornness, it's my objective opinion of the end user experience - more trouble, but more pleasure along with it.  The trouble part doesn't usually last all that long... and most of it this time around has been because I insisted on going 13th gen i9 before maybe it was matured, haha... I still do not regret, unnecessary as it is.  Those problems are sorted, for now.

I do understand people who don't want to deal with the headache a PC can be.  I get it completely.  There were moments of regret... but they're long faded.  A shadow of regret, maybe, but not really regret.  I won't get that time back - but I won't get this experience (...not to mention versatility) from any console, either.  Not even close.  The money I spent on this PC will likely keep me for the next decade, if I actually WANT to go that long without upgrading... which is unlikely.",GgJj9Mok9dA,True
@Magnus_Loov,2024-04-23T13:58:26Z,0,"1. The main reason: I already (and always have) own a PC. For the same cost as a console I would get a much more powerful graphics card and at the same time have all the other benefits. For me who always owns a powerful enough desktop PC that I upgrade regularly this is just a no-brainer.
2. Mods. The ability to mod a game or even just tweak the graphics settings is just insanely powerful for the PC.
3. Customizing the hardware setup. Overclock CPU, GPU, tweak other stuff etc.
4. The biggest and most diverse library of software. Many simulation games, strategy games etc are more common on PC. IN addition to that the insane amount of emulators running all kinds of emulations of past hardware including Arcade machines (Mame).
5. Mouse and Keyboard support as main controller. This is a really big one! I play almost all games with keyboard and mouse. But have a 360 controller that also can be used for some few specific games.

@davidknightx,2024-04-23T07:02:51Z,0,"Budgeting expert here. But them all. PC, console, etc. The money isn't in the hardware. It's ALWAYS been in the software (i.e. games) unless you're only buying just a few games for the life of the system.

Buy a console, when a new one comes out, wait about a year or less to make sure it works, then sell the old one. This happens about every 7 years. Save a few dollars a month ($36/yr or $257/every 7yrs). You will easily get about half your money back on the old system eBay sale which means you only need about $250+ to upgrade which you'll already have saved up.

Do the same for your graphics card. You may need to upgrade a little more often, but it's entirely up to you. I would put away about $10/month. Sell the old graphics card and you'll have to money already saved when it comes to upgrading. I spend roughly a few hundred per major PC upgrade.

Learn to shop around. All the consoles/PC give you a TON of options: Steam, PS Store (always has a sale going on), Xbox GamePass, physical used games on eBay (don't bother with GameStop), etc.

Take good care of your gaming hardware so it sales higher. Learn how to sale on eBay. Just pretend you're the person interested in buying it. What would YOU be looking for to make you feel better about the purchase. Learn eBay fees and calculate the costs (you'll roughly lose 13% so $250 sale means you'll only get $217.50). Factor this in your estimates, but in the end, it means very little to have to come up with another $30 for a new PS6.


I've bought a TON of games and, when I look back on how much I've actually spent, I honestly feel more guilty about it than pirating. The deals are that good. I don't know why I feel worse...I guess it's because if I'm pirating, I didn't really care much about the game to begin with; but with a Steam sale or whatever, I do care...but still getting it for hardly nothing.",GgJj9Mok9dA,True

Eventually got away from PCs due to costs...becoming a homeowner...starting a family...priorities change...you get the picture.  Anywho, I remember one time back in the late 90s when a new game would fail to run on my top of the line PC & I could not figure out for the life of me why that was happening.  So after days of research, I found  out there was some DLL conflict with Visual Basic.  So having Visual Basic installed was preventing the game from running.  So basically, if your PC is a general purpose PC & not a dedicated gaming box, you were going to come across software or driver conflicts that were going to prevent you from running some games now & then.  I recently touched base with a current PC gamer that confirmed this issue does still pop up every now & then.   As for console, in exchange for trading down to lesser performance, you get a stable consistent hardware base that the developers can code specifically for without having those occasional incompatibilities over things you should not have to worry about.

But I do get the appeal of a console - it's a compact system, usually it will just work out of the box and you can be sure that the games you get (for that console) will work fine. It's simple and easy, especially if you're just playing casually.

However, there are a bunch of reasons why I personally have always preferred PCs. Chief among which is, I still play a bunch of older games, most of which have never been released on console and wouldn't work on newer ones anyways. Then, there's the whole modding aspect; I tend to mod some of my games (quite heavily), which doesn't really work on console. Storage space limitation and other capabilities like streaming and working are also factors (although they are slowly disappearing). Then, there's upgradability. And the fact that I've built the systems myself. And lastly (for me, that is) - I don't like controllers, I've always preferred a mouse/keyboard combination.

Also, the part of ""building a PC is fun"" - is very true. Although there are also some pain points, like me having random system freezes for about a year until ASUS got their software fixed. Before that, the first mainboard I installed had a faulty LAN chip (which was known, but ASUS stubbornly kept using that same model despite the problems). Now, I'm running a really weird fan setup because airflow in the case I decided on isn't ideal. Still, I'm already looking at which parts I want in my next system and the one I'm running now will become (with a few changes) a secondary system for my partner (who is running a laptop as their primary system).

@wolfsaddle,2024-04-21T14:58:39Z,0,"I got the PS5 while waiting for gpu availability to recover and for my income to get better. Don't regret it. I've used it a lot till I got the new PC and there are still titles that I enjoy playing on the PS5.
PS5 pros: cheaper, plug and play, easy to use on a couch with a big TV, no research needed, exclusives, dvd player function, great for local multiplayer 
 
PC pros: can be used for anything with a little bit of work, modding is great, cheaper games (but not by a lot if you're a casual/average gamer)

I've bought long cables to connect the PCs to the TV from a different room, but it's been months and I haven't bothered with it yet :)

Bottom line, it can make sense if it suits the situation, like mine above. If you're really tight with money, already have an ok TV and you don't wanna wait, a console is great (and you keep your old PC a little longer). If you can afford a good PC there are less arguments for a console really. 

For me exclusives are not incentive enough and don't like that sometimes I have to duplicate the costs to have it in both places for convenience. Cross platform saves are not far along enough yet and won't be useful anyway when you're modding.",GgJj9Mok9dA,True

tv versus hi-ref monitor boils down to personal preference just like pc vs console.
i prefer using a tv, and competitive fps games in vr (point and shoot is hard to beat).
Hi-ref monitor requires sitting at a desk to be close enough to the screen for it to matter.
tv can mount on a wall, save valuable floor space and save more room for VR.
These are two totally different types of setups that can cater to various different wants and needs.

square footage costs more than ever.
sitting at a desk for hours isn't always the most comfortable
not all games get an advantage from hi-ref rate
with vr, there's more displays and space utilization to consider",GgJj9Mok9dA,True

There's a faction who believes their high-end PC's are being marginalized due to the need to make Asobo (Microsoft's software developer) content play well on Xbox.  That flight sim is perhaps the most resource-intensive game out there, and with the current FS2020 code (which was ported over from old FSX code) the sim will push almost any PC really hard - because the code is not optimized for multi-core CPU's.  In order to reduce the hit, there's no doubt that graphical fidelity must be reduced on the Xbox.  That makes some PC owners feel like the hardware they paid for is not being utilized to its fullest extent, and that the problem is getting worse as more an more Xbox users complain about sim performance.

Microsoft/Asobo has indicated that the upcoming release of FS2024 will become more of a SaaS model, with scenery and textures being almost completely cloud-based.  That will obviously reduce or eliminate the gap in hardware-dependent performance, and create a gap between those who can afford high-speed internet, and those who can't afford, or are unable to get, high-speed internet.

Game lifespan : Xbox WinCore & Hyper-v (theoretically, forever) > Windows native execution (longest API BC support among OSes) > PS native execution (game can only last a gen or 2 without forever-patching).


Why is native exec giving you shorter lifespan? Because of hardware & software deprecation.

GTA5 weren't compatible on launch, with some AMD hardware, meaning? It might not run on future hardware. Happens on iOS, Android, Mac, NES, SS, DC, PS1-5. Xbox tackled the issue with WinCore & Hyper-V in 2016.

True about XBOX, the two reasons to have an Xbox would be the game sharing that you can do with another Xbox user, and backwards compatibility with the Xbox 360 and original Xbox games, that work with it. Otherwise, there’s really not much of a point at all. I still own one, because that was the first new generation console I could get, the series X, the PS five was still really hard to get at the time. I still like physical games, but the fact that many console games are forgoing discs or crippling them to where you have to connect to the Internet to even play the game, has driven me more and more towards PC gaming. Nintendo is the only real exception for me at this point, because their exclusives are still just on their system, plus they do interesting things that aren’t really done elsewhere.",GgJj9Mok9dA,True

Never bought another Xbox after that.  Oh andthe flat rate fee for getting a console repaired out of warranty is laughable too.  Even if it was to have an LED replaced in your console if it's out of warranty ... £360 I think it was.  Not well we'll charge you a flat fee of say £50 to even look at it. And THEN we will hit you with an estimate before we start work on it.  NOPE. £360 up front for them to even look at it. I was so disgusted I never wanted an XBox again. And I was a loyal XBoxer.

@johnjoobooks,2024-04-17T14:04:23Z,0,"Appreciate the thoughtful video, though have to disagree on some of the things.

  Consoles being not upgrade able - is the real Pro, not a Con. Games that developed for PCs are rarely optimized, nowadays they just simply released at beta stage and sold as finished product. More than that - VERY often developers dont bother with optimization and tweaking, by excusing themselves with ""Its just your PC not powerful enough. Upgrade"" crap.

  On consoles, developers HAVE to pass the relative quality check, and HAVE to make their game run at least in acceptable way on the unified hardware. Of course, badly optimized games happen too, but that is exception, not the rule, as it is on PC.
  And even better - the later in console's life the game comes out - it actually looks and runs BETTER, since developers had the time to learn all the fine details of hardware and find ways to squeeze maximum of it. 

  That was the main reason I left PC and got myself PS5. No tweaking, no ""update your BIOS because we dont feel like doing our job"" nonsense.  Turn on, play, it works. ALWAYS. In best way that is possible for that game on that hardware. Developers chasing your gaming hardware, not you chasing them.

  And don't get me started on the scam that PC gaming hardware is. GPUs 7 years old still running better than today's 400$ ones. DLSS is a sad joke, etc etc  

  The only reason I'm thinking about getting new PC is - Tarkov. Damn that game! Developed by drunken monkeys, optimized by rolling their faces on the keyboard, but the game loop itself is SO addictive!",GgJj9Mok9dA,True

@phillipfiorentino,2024-04-17T11:41:39Z,0,"So this is important. Other than the switch, which I own, I do not have any other current gen handheld consoles. I do however have the following:

Xbox Series X
PS5
Gaming PC (Lyte Technologies)
Gaming Laptop (MSI STEALTH 17"")

And I currently game on an 85"" UHD TV (TCL) With Dolby Vision and 120Hz and 60Hz at 4K and it has 2 HDMI 2.1 ports. In order to have more than 2 things hooked up, I have to use an HDMI switch to add more than the 2 or just unplug cables to plug the current system up that I'm using.

Here's the bottomline scoop. Forget console exclusives, because that is now becoming a thing of the past for the most part.

Microsoft is adamant about wanting gamers to be able to access any title past or present that is purchased on their newer systems in today's day and age, which has also encouraged Sony to do the same thing with PSN games as far as accounts and access go.

While Jay does mention this and recap it towards the end of the video, there's a lot of other clout discussion of PC which is not the focus of why you should consider a console.

There are a few TVs that are basically the same quality as if not better than some monitors, so it's very important to factor in a 60/120Hz TV for this purpose, or you can hook everything up to a monitor but this all depends on whether you want to game from a couch or a chair.

The main subject issue is cost. The cheapest PC that brings the EXACT SAME quality as a PS5 / XB Series X is anywhere from $1500 to $1700. You can go cheaper, but it will shoot the performance to less than what a console gives for the price range, and this will change with the times as things get cheaper.

The reality is, you could buy an amazing 65"" - 75"" 4K UHD TV at 120Hz with (240 motion rate and VRR) for just over $400 and a brand new PS5 or Xbox Series X for $500 MSRP + Around $25 - $50 for tax on those items.

You could use the same amount of money for the gaming PC tower itself for a TV center and speaker bar with a sub woofer and Hyper X headset for PC and still have money to burn.

The budget for a PC that exceeds my consoles was exactly $3376.69 and mine was a carefully put together pre-built.

I've been building PCs since I was 9. I'm 36 now, and anyone looking to start gaming for the first time should really consider a console first.

If it's not a hobby for them now, and they don't dedicate much time to it, they barely spend but a fraction of the cost to start, whereas getting a PC would be a super expensive endeavor for someone who may or may not stick with gaming.

If you're new to gaming and prefer a couch and living room setup, get a console, save some money, and game.

As of April 17 of 2024, if you must get a gaming PC that can go to 120Hz and up between 1080p and 4K the price range can go from $1600 - $3500 and at that point you really have to evaluate whether you're trying to spend a lot of money or less and are you really gonna game all that much?

This message isn't for enthusiasts. You already know what you like and this video wouldn't be for an enthusiast because they don't need what they like and why they like explained.

If you're wanting to build a PC, at that point, the issue isn't what you prefer gaming on. Just get the bloody PC and stop thinking about it.

For everyone else who just wants to game, in this economy, get a bloody console. You will have 3 times the funds or save money if you already own a TV.",GgJj9Mok9dA,True

One other things (edit) On PC its easier to get more games for cheaper even newer games than on console. SO while PC may be expensive, if you like a lot of games it'll be cheaper in the long run.

But that's the great thing about it, I choose where I spend money, both software and hardware wise. I set the budget, and I choose where I want that to go to. I can set up 3 monitors and connect it to my 4K TV all at the same time. It's all about what I want to do about it.

The major issue I have is portability. It's a pain in the ass to unplug everything from my PC and bring it to the living room if I feel like showing my family a game. Luckily, this is where another HUGE pro comes in: After an upgrade, my old hardware isn't abandoned.

I had a i7 8700, 2070 Super, and 32gb of 2666MHz RAM (I got the mobo on sale, that's why the RAM couldn't go higher lol). I recently upgraded my GPU to a 3080ti, and a little later my CPU to a 12700k, and 6000MHz DDR5 RAM. I did all this over the course of a few months when stuff went on sale, and got it all for just under $1000.

I got tired of lugging my heavy ass PC downstairs, so I bought a new case for my newer parts since I was still using my old Corsair 4000D, and rebuilt both PCs. Now I have a dedicated PC in the living room with my old parts, but the 2070 Super and 8700 are still playing games at high settings on 1440p.

It's not like going from a PS3 to a PS4, and just keeping the old console in the other less-played area, where some games lose support on one console and continue support on the other. My ""old"" PC still plays all the same games. I don't have to worry about buying any upgrades to make it work on my new PC, I don't have to worry about a game losing support. I just tinker with the settings, and boom, it's ready to go.

Sometimes if I really feel like it, I pull the 3080ti out of my new PC and put it in the old one, so I can play in 4K downstairs lol",GgJj9Mok9dA,True
@bigpunk157,2024-04-15T23:58:34Z,0,"If you're a student in the US, your built PC is able to be claimed as an educational expense, and you could get more than what you spent in parts through the american opportunity credit when you do your taxes.  I think I've made probably 4k from the last 5 years of computer parts, building both my wife and I's rigs and updating parts.  There is no reason to think about the expense of this decision if you've got options available for you to get them cheaper.  If you don't have this available to you, you can always buy parts open box or used.  My 3080 TI was 600 bucks instead of 980 because I got it open box through amazon.

@Ebike_Enthusiast,2024-04-15T09:16:17Z,1,There’s also Sony exclusives on Xbox and pc. If I was to recommend a console over pc (I wouldn’t) it would be the Xbox because it’s significantly more powerful. I own series X. Ps5. And have a pc and laptop in different rooms. Pc is the way but my Xbox does everything my PlayStation does except better. Now although Ive played most of each consoles exclusive titles I’d say they both are absolute dog 💩.

@LocoSantiago22,2024-04-15T07:49:15Z,0,"Lot of great points in the video. I actually have always been a console gamer for most of my life since the glory days of the N64. For this current Gen I started out with the switch, then  got the Series X because I think as far as features and performance, and easy to use for me, I think it is the better console, once COVID scalpers calmed down in 2023 I got a PS5 only just for PS5 exclusives. Once I had all three consoles I never really saw myself getting a PC. Thought they were too expensive and just liked plugging a TV and just game, even thought I never closed the door on getting a PC. 

Well after a lot of working and busting my butt and actually needing to upgrade from a 2011 MacBook Air that still runs surprisingly well, I said screw it I’m going to get a do it all PC and was able to setup including a Intel 14900KS, RTX 4090, 64 GB of DDR5 6000mhz RAM with a z790 motherboard, not just for gaming but for everything I need. And I’ll tell you, playing my first games on there were absolutely mind blowing. Performance was of course way better, I was getting way better visuals from a Samsung G9 OLED 1440p monitor over my Xbox and PS5 on a LG C3 OLED 4K TV.  It really changed my perspective on PC gaming and gave me a new appreciation for PC. 

But with all that being said, I love having  all my consoles and my new PC. I know you can play everything on Xbox on PC , but I just don’t want to get rid of it, mainly becauseI like just having access to everything. My wife games but actually prefers a console so when when we play together she uses the Xbox and I use my PC on cross-play or if we just want to have a party night, play some good ole Switch games.",GgJj9Mok9dA,True

@sheed64,2024-04-15T02:21:22Z,0,"Love PCs, but there is no doubt that pretty much all FPS games on PC are infested with hackers. Xbox has forced crossplay, so it's dead in the water. PS5 doesn't force crossplay, but going from 240/360fps gaming on PC to 120fps on PS5 feels horrible. I even get nauseous sometimes having to adjust to the drop in motion clarity.


My pipe dream is having something like CS2 be released on the PS platform, and for the next PS to offer consistent 240fps gameplay on shooters. The former still seems farfetched, while the latter can easily be achieved on popular shooters with correct optimization, considering the leaps in GPU tech since the Nvidia 2xxx and AMD 5xxx series, to which the XSX and PS5 could be reliably compared to.

Sure there are games that are only on PC and that's because they were made for specifically and not on consoles which is good thing for those who prefer PC over Console but that means they might miss out on certain games that hasn't and possibly will not come to PC and same thing the other way around.

- I like having a full keyboard and mouse rather than a controller.
- I don't like sharing my screen time. 😆 I game alone. Plus, I think hogging TV time from others is ignorant.

Tbf, most of the issue with consoles is that the hardware is capable of better performance but developers no longer seem to care about optimizing their games. Even on PC it’s the same deal. Innovations like DLSS should be used to improve upon ALREADY optimized games for example but instead it’s being used as a crutch by developers who are taking shortcuts and leaving it up to AI features to optimize for them.  But that’s a whole different story.

@mikelreborn3254,2024-04-14T12:39:03Z,0,"Since their respective launches, the PlayStation 5 has seen the release of **656** games, while the Xbox Series X/S has had **424** games released. These figures represent the titles released natively for each console and do not include backward-compatible games. It is important to note that the gaming libraries for both consoles are continuously expanding, with new titles being added on a regular basis.

Comparatively, by this point in their life cycles, the PlayStation 4 boasted a library of **3347** games, and the Xbox One had **2871** games available.

In essence, three years into the Xbox One's life cycle, it had nearly 3000 games released. However, the Xbox Series X has only 423 games released three years post-launch. The same observation applies to the PlayStation. It is perplexing to see such a disparity in the number of games available between these console generations at the same stage of their release.

I bought a Xbox because I'm already in the Microsoft ecosystem being a PC Gamer my last gaming  PC was a Dell G7 with a 1650 ... I didn't feel like power to Performance with PCS was worth the price but there's no f****** games for the consoles unless you want to play generation 8 games, very unhappy with my purchase of the Xbox series X I would havehave felt the same way with the PlayStation 5. But if you're truly paying attention retro games are coming back into style especially with Gen Z then you have stuff like the Odin 2 in the retroid pocket that are gaining popularity and emulators that you have to use to play those games that's the way I'm going to be going after this, we're getting tired of games being half-ass made when they release them to us for $60-70 and we're tired of microtransactions.",GgJj9Mok9dA,True

I built a pretty sweet PC about 10 years ago now for 2800 CAD and it's been able to tackle everything that's come out to acceptable quality for that time period. However heldivers 2 came out and my CPU is the exact CPU listed on the MINIMUM specs. I'm thinking if it can still play this game thats great but how much longer until a game comes out that I'm actually locked out of? So I've been toying with the idea of building a new PC (1500-2000$ prospect) or do I just go buy a PS5 and get back into that eco system for 1/3rd the cost? One of the reasons I sold my ps4 was the load times sucked compared to my PC and with limited time in my day I wanted to play PC more because of that. Now that load times are greatly reduced on ps5 it really is a tough decision. Plus call me a sucker but I do like the trophy system on playstation.

3 Years ago I bought a ""Gaming Laptop"". I put those two words in quotes, as I now realize they're two words that do not belong together. What it did however, was really open up a new world. VR, Streaming, content creation, being able to play any title from any generation on Steam.

And the biggest thing I didn't see coming, I have a strong itch to build my own PC. It's not in the budget for now, but I've learned a much information as I can to be ready when I get all the parts I'd need. 

Older Consoles still have validity to me. There's nothing like grabbling the old SNES and having a day of nostalgia on my 100 pound CRT TV. However, I just can't justify buying new systems,  as they just limit my options. My PC now makes me money through streaming, so there's no way I could go back. I look forward to building my first one. :)",GgJj9Mok9dA,True

Myself I've gamed on both since 1996 & always swayed back & forth between which I prefer, but currently that's playing on console despite having a decently powerful PC. Some of that is current game choice, but most of it is working full-time in IT support & not wanting to troubleshoot any PC issues when I'm off the clock just to play a game. Also my consoles update my games & themselves while in rest mode, something my PC doesn't do & I wish it did.

The thing about catching the PC bug is real though, I used to work as a PC builder at Canada Computers & that scratched the itch for a long time for me. I think when someone is younger or the experience is fresh for them it can be a lot of fun & I even built my most recent PC myself despite being more starved for time as I've gotten married & other life events have occurred. That's partly why I land on consoles now too with so many games across tons of hardware (older pc titles too) that I want to play or re-play, spending less time on hardware & tweaking setting to get my experience just the way I want has allowed me to focus on just playing the game & enjoying my time.

@Wesley8Bit,2024-04-12T20:57:12Z,0,"For me console gaming is better. 
A few reasons

Plug and Play Perfection: With consoles, you get the ease of just plugging in and playing. No need for driver updates or hardware compatibility checks. It’s like having a faithful dog that’s always ready to play fetch, no training required!

The Comfort Factor: Console gaming is the king of couch comfort. Why sit at a desk when you can sprawl out on a sofa with a controller in hand? It’s the gaming equivalent of choosing a hammock over a hard chair.

Exclusivity is Key: Consoles often have exclusive games that you can’t find on PC. It’s like being part of an exclusive club where the secret handshake is knowing the latest console-only titles.

No Upgrade Anxiety: With a console, you’re set for years. No need to worry about your graphics card being outdated by next Tuesday. It’s the gaming world’s answer to a “set it and forget it” rotisserie oven.

Social Gaming Glory: Consoles are social butterflies. They love local multiplayer and party games. PCs, on the other hand, are the hermits of the gaming world, often preferring solitary online adventures.

The Price is Right: Generally, consoles are more wallet-friendly than a high-end gaming PC. It’s like choosing between a fancy restaurant and a gourmet meal that’s ready-made at home for a fraction of the price.

Unified Control: A console comes with a controller that’s been fine-tuned for gaming. PCs have a mouse and keyboard, which are great for spreadsheets but can feel like bringing a pen to a sword fight in the gaming arena.",GgJj9Mok9dA,True

@PeakedPanda,2024-04-12T18:27:13Z,0,"""Xbox made it very clear they are getting away from hardware"" 
I think you might be reading into this incorrectly. While YES it is true they have the xbox app on windows PCs and YES you can play a lot of games on PC that are available through game pass.. I think you'd be surprised. I think Microsoft is taking the route of a ""merger"" of the two. It was only a year or year and half ago that xbox made a deal with discord to incorporate that software into the xbox hud. There is also a potential deal in the works right now to ADD STEAM TO XBOX. So games you'd normally only run through steam on a PC, will be available on an XBOX.

And last part.. digging really deep in the rumor mill for this one so take with a VERY large grain of salt. Xbox had the latest GPU in the XSX custom made. Rumor is... they plan to make affordable upgradable xbox's in the future to swap parts in and out and upgrade the console with a water-down version of windows.. (which is basically like what xbox hud is now) basically an XBOX PC... so an XBOX PC with Discord.. WITH STEAM... AND GAME PASS..

Now on console, well...if something goes bad or it just dies you got to replace the whole console, either sending it to the console manufacturer or just having to buy a replacement which can cost hundreds of bucks.And if it's an even older console, good luck with that(as that usually requires online).

The blu ray drive could go bad and you would have to replace it. But now Microsoft and Sony made it even harder to do that as opening those consoles are way harder than previous gen ones.The HDMI port or gpu in the console could go bad and that's a full replacement right there.

The Nvme could die and that's pretty much it, definitely for PS5. Sony decided to solder the main Nvme to the PS5 so you can't even replace it if it dies meaning you need a new PS5. This is a step back from the PS3 and PS4 where you could easily replace the hard drive if it fails.

@j800r_aswell,2024-04-11T20:46:09Z,1,"I have to disagree. I'm a console enthusiast. Passionate? It depends on to what degree. I will defend consoles to my grave.

I have dipped my toes into PC gaming more than once. I was not converted. First time, I had a custom gaming PC built by a local store around late 2008. It was great for as long as it lasted. Which probably wasn't even a year. Spent the rest of the time troubleshooting it. The store could not work it out. Issue would also not happen for them. They didn't look at the raptor drive they put in it as they claimed those hardly ever go. Stuck with my consoles for gaming an in late 2010 just grabbed an iMac for my computing (and WoW playing). In late 2015 got an MSI gaming laptop. The thing served my well but generally I still prefered the convenience of gaming on console where possible. These days, I'm pretty much exclusively console with the exception of also owning a Steam Deck. 30fps is not a dealbreaker. I do not game competetively and 30fps gaming has not hindered my personal performance or experience in any way. If it did, most modern games come with a performance mode that targets 60.

Another negative to PC gaming is it locks you to Windows. I hate Windows. I'm not gonna support the monopoly just to be able to game on PC. Consoles my be limited in what they can do but the result is that they are exceedingly good in what they do. Modern games on the PS5 look incredible. I'm sure they can look better with a more expensive PC but these days it's nitpicking. Horizon Forbidden West on PS5 looks stunning. Cyberpunk looks great. Baldur's Gate 3 looks great.

A console is great for when you just wanna relax and game without the hassle. PC gaming will never be completely hassle free.",GgJj9Mok9dA,True

1. you don't need a $1500 pc to last for years. i built one, but it was for future upgradability to being able to run UE5 software in the future, meaning capability to support 16 core zen next gen cpus and whatever powerful gpu will be available in a few years. anyone can game on an $800 pc for years, just not at ultra settings. you will be paying $800 for the console anyway by the time 6 years of network fees are accounted for.

2. when buying a console, you are buying a brand, not a system. whatever sony has as exclusives, are exclusive to that platform, and not necessarily a part of any other platform within the console space. to take part of ""console"" realistically means having all consoles then.

3. pc gaming is not exclusively about tinkering, it is about the being able to change components when needed, not because of mandatory replacements. the components that require updates the most are the gpu and cpu. the AM4 and AM5 have made changing motherboards not as much of a relevant importance through time. hard drive, power supply, case, fans and cooler are only a change if broken type of situation.",GgJj9Mok9dA,True

Spend hours trying to get the perfect graphics settings to min/max my pc power. New gen of gpu comes out. Drop almost $2000 now. Oh and here's the 12th game launcher for this other exclusive game launcher game.

I work in Tech as well so I spent 9 hours a day at a desk staring at a monitor already so when I'm done with work for the day the last thing I want to do is continue to sit at said desk staring at said monitor. So gaming just lost all the fun it used to have when I first got into it back in my youth.

So between work, girlfriend, friends, family, new puppy, free time just gets to short to always be adjusting settings to get something to run, I switched to the PS5, reignited old friendships and never looked back. Plus hard to argue with that $400 price tag compared to a PC price tag.

@jemmerx,2024-04-10T14:42:27Z,0,"This video does a great job going over the pros and cons of each side. 

For me, as the need arose over the years I've had a PC to do those things and also I also game on it. I wouldn't get a PC for the _sole_ purpose of gaming. That is not worth it, IMO, diminishing returns and all that. But once you need a PC for anything, then paying a bit more for more power and being able to game, hell yeah! 

These days, console works for me. I have no need of the extra power beyond my little Surface. When I game, I just want to sit on the couch and play. What I pay for what I get is very cost effective for me. I'm also not 'young' anymore (except mentally).

Whatever is best for you and your situation, be that the purpose of the machine, and available resources, is the way you should go.

On a side note and to underline what was said in this video, my exposure to PC long ago (a 286, for those that know) and wanting to be able to play games let to me developing a whole host of PC skills that did lead to a career in the business. That came from PC. So I might suggest that if you are 'young,' and can afford, or have a family situation that supports it, to go for PC as the skills you will learn may take you places and translate well into many fields.",GgJj9Mok9dA,True

There's also the mods...ALL THE MODS. Console, sort of, but not like on PC. There's also more games on PC available then console. Plus there's emulators to play console games. Retroarch anyone? 

For consoles it's the price and plug and play. Then there's Nintendo only titles...but Nintendo has gone downhill since the Wii. Wii was the last great console they made. Although Breath of the Wild and the sequel ain't bad. Still waiting on Starfox and F-Zero...AND METROID PRIME 4 FFS...But yeah that's it for me on consoles. OH. Jay...you forgot to mention...the PS3 used 2.5"" drives which were upgradable. My brother did it on ours. Put an SSD in there.

While PCs are better, consoles do have a place. Like you said 1500 bucks minimum vs 500 bucks is a YUGE difference. Case in point. I've mentioned to people I carry around a 40 dollar buck knife as my cheap knife and they look at me like that's too expensive. It's a decent knife and at 40 bucks that's DIRT CHEAP when knives can cost hundreds of dollars. So when people look at ya like you're crazy for carrying around something that really is cheap, but to them that's rich money, you know there's no way in hell they'd ever afford a PC to play games let alone consoles, but if they had to have something consoles are it.

The fact that you can play games on PC going back 30+ years through emulation and the fact that all new games have a good modding life to remove inconveniences or dramatically change the experience of a game is simply priceless. You can say whatever you want about the affordability of consoles but the fact that they are such closed systems and considering how fewer and fewer games now come out to justify a purchase, they are just not worth it.

Yeah, there's digital as well, but physical is still a strong market for Nintendo. More so than Xbox and Play Station.

@IsaacG8,2024-04-09T17:16:27Z,0,"In an era where the boundaries between gaming platforms are increasingly blurred, it's becoming evident that, with the notable exception of Nintendo, the traditional console model may be heading towards obsolescence, akin to the fate of the dinosaurs. This trend is underscored by the strategic moves of industry titans like Sony and Microsoft, who have begun to bridge the divide by offering their once-exclusive titles on PC platforms.

My personal gaming setup, which includes a high-performance PC, Xbox Series X, and PlayStation 5, serves as a microcosm of this shifting landscape. The PlayStation 5, despite its cutting-edge capabilities, has been leveraged for a mere handful of exclusive titles - a stark contrast to the rich libraries of its predecessors at similar lifecycle stages. The Xbox Series X's role in my collection has been even more diminished; initially poised as a conduit for retro gaming, it has largely been superseded by the PC for accessing Microsoft's exclusive games. Despite my enthusiasm for gaming and a penchant for collecting consoles, my engagement with the Series X has been minimal since its acquisition in 2021.

In stark contrast, my experience with the Nintendo Switch underscores the enduring appeal of a platform that cherishes exclusivity. Within my personal collection, the Switch boasts over 30 titles, a figure that eclipses 40 when considering digital acquisitions. This robust library is a testament to Nintendo's unwavering dedication to offering unique, platform-specific experiences. Unlike its contemporaries, Nintendo's strategy has ensured that the Switch remains a vibrant ecosystem for exclusive content, affirming the distinct and irreplaceable role of dedicated gaming consoles in a landscape increasingly dominated by cross-platform accessibility.",GgJj9Mok9dA,True

We didn't have money to purchase parts, so I started fixing PCs to make my builds, and one thing led to another. I also know people who have been in a similar situation. 
I often talk to parents who are afraid of the PC hobby, and I always tell them to direct their kids. Of course, as anything, it can become a bad thing. But if a kid is properly directed, a silly hobby can expand a myriad of career possibilities a few years later.
The possibilities a PC brings, the curiosity it attracts, and the problem-solving skills you have to develop, are things that cannot be neglected. On the other hand, a console is obviously just a console.

1. im a part time gamer/streamer and i have access to discord, twitch and everything else i need on xbox and its so much simpler to use
2. im an EA gamer. i play madden and NBA 2k and both of those games function way better on the Next Gen consoles vs PC, also updates come out way more frequently.
3. less cheaters across the board when gaming on FPS shooters. pretty self explanatory, cheating on a console is much less frequent but does still happen here and there.
4. more reasonable competition. if you play controller and arent in the top 5% skill level of gamer then you know true pain when you enter cross platform games and everyone is more accurate, can turn faster, and move better than you. 
5. Price Point. i sold my 2000$ PC and switched to console full time a year ago. since then ive upgraded my Monitor, Speakers, got multiple controllers and a new desk with the money i sold my PC for. and my overall gaming experience hasnt skipped a beat.

Flight Sims are better on PC because of storage and processor power.

PC can have multiple monitors and higher resolutions. I run a Super Ultra Wide with and second monitor to the side to open websites while I play. Can't do that on console.

I have used a PC for a whole year and I played a ton of new titles and old titles. The only thing that makes the PC look bad is the fact that the PC ports from Playstation or Xbox are horrendously unoptimized. These games are most of the time, updated and go through a lot of optimizations and eventually, you'll get them to be properly optimized. Look at The Last of Us part 1 port for example, it was stupidly bad when it launched and had tons of crashes but now, it's in a somewhat playable state with FSR 3 to help performance issues. The new games that come out horribly unoptimized for PC are also horribly unoptimized for playstation. A good example of this would be The Dragons Dogma 2 which runs at probably 20-40 FPS at performance mode in town areas. Outside the town, it's mostly fine unless you're near water apparently. Another example of a bad launch would be Star Wars: Jedi Survivor. It ran with shitty FPS that was constantly at 40-50s and it was filled with stutters.

Why is native exec giving you shorter lifespan? Because of hardware & software deprecation.
GTA5 weren't compatible on launch, with some AMD hardware, meaning? It might not run on future hardware. Happens on iOS, Android, Mac, NES, SS, DC, PS1-4. Xbox tackled the issue with WinCore & Hyper-V in 2016.

And Microsoft doesn't release ""updates"" that cripple games unless you are upgrading from Windows 7. 
 
Steam also doesn't release updates to games. They update their own software, and some game companies can give you updates via the Steam app, but these are the same exact ""updates"" delivered to the console versions of the games.
 
If you've updated a driver or something and a game you play doesn't like it--you just rollback your system to prior to the update. It's barely an inconvenience. Unless you are running Windows 95 on a 486 motherboard, I have no idea what you're on about here.",GgJj9Mok9dA,True

1.) Easy one - graphical power. Even at medium settings let’s say, my game looks way better than any console and will run at more than double the frames.

2.) upgrades - it’s awesome to know that when a deal comes out or when just when you want to make your pc more powerful, you can. You don’t need to wait 7 years for the new console and typically it will be stronger than any console for many years.

3.) customizable - kinda like Jay said, make it your own. Make it bright and colorful, super cooled, add a bunch of fans, whatever, it’s yours.

4.) future proofing - I can buy a piece of hardware and know that I will be having the best gaming experience possible for many many years and not have to worry about the next big console. This kinda ties in with another point I made.

Games without controller support on Steam will automatically keybind the most popular binding to your controller so you can play the games without binding them yourself. 

Emulation is also a one time setup and you can use BigBox app to launch games and emulators using your gamepad too on the sofa and it just works.

@Fxtricky1,2024-04-08T15:24:23Z,0,Not all the games on gamepass are the same and you cant play the xbox originals or 360 games on a pc. Also Consoles are also extremly similar to phones i.e. having a service plan or gate to play online or use. If you dont pay the 60 a year for psplus or 15 a month for gamepass both systems are basically bricks. And if you look at the cost of both over time they might as well cost the same as the pc outside of games which is far easier and cheaper to get on pc with stores like epic giving games for free every week or steam sales and humble and even key stores like g2a. Bottom line a pc compare to consoles is more akin to a bike vs a car. The pc or car is a machine thats designed to be an investment. the bike will still get you places as a console would but its not the same as a consumer product designed to absorb over time. Thats also why both companies want in on the mobile market. Good vid btw.,GgJj9Mok9dA,True

Also, the portability combined with its ability to be played on a tv/monitor as a console is also worth considering. 

To me, consoles are about convenience. More for people who are into games but not into knowing how they work.

For me, Steam, much as we may resent its near-monopoly power, is a huge boon in terms of organising and keeping updated all my games, and its regular sales reward those with patience.
Choice is also a big factor in accessories - when it comes to alternative controller styles, external drives etc, there are always going to be more options for the PC market.

And on top of that, setting a console up is stress free; the last PC I built required a lot of time to get it running, and with the price of components being pretty high, not to mention it being the only PC available (meaning, if something went wrong, all access would be down to cell phone level, if any at all), it was also quite stressful. And if something goes wrong in the future, I will have to troubleshoot and repair everything myself, with just a phone to help me through it.

1. had okay gaming PC (R9-3900x + GTX1080)
2. bought XBSX to supplement gaming (plugged into LG G2 4K OLED)
3. Guardians of the Galaxy ran great!
4. tried some OLDER games and I was shocked at how POORLY they looked and ran compared to same game on my PC (low res, 30FPS, stutters. what?)
5. Hated the main menu.
6. BluRay player was loud. Unusably loud, especially with the 4K movie I bought.
7. GotG disappeared off the Gamepass subscription a week after I bought the console. SIGH. (major problem as I take a long time to finish games and like to replay them. So I'd really need to BUY them anyway)
8. XBSX started having trouble connecting to my TV (including when I stuck in a BluRay disc). Turns out some HDCP chip was likely defective and failing (a known issue).
9. Jumped at the chance to return it since it was defective.
10. Bought an RTX4070. Hooked PC up to my LG G2.... very, very happy with my new ""console"" 
11. PS6 ?
(only big issue is I switch between an old 1440p monitor and my 4K TV. It's a hassle as one has HDR, different resolution and the sound can get confused etc. So I mostly just switch to the 4K TV on the weekend to play a single game then I switch back.

@What_In_This_World,2024-04-08T00:01:51Z,0,"5:34  the digital aspect of the pc/xbox/sony systems are precisely why the switch is doing so well with the kids of people born in the 80s like myself, cartridge based media is the way to go, and pc gamers need to start demanding this. As a former member of the PCMR, I can tell you, I have never been as satisfied with my steam account as I have been with my drawer full of Switch games. There needs to be a revolution in the PC market, and there needs to be a revolution in the PC hardware side to accommodate. We need truly high speed and reliable SD cards, I’m talking at least usb 3.2 gen 2 or more preferably, USB4. We need a major game company, perhaps CDPR, or Rockstar or the like, to take the lead, and release a major game, like Witcher 4 or GTA6, on a high speed SD card. You don’t have to run the game off of it, you could still use it as install medium, but you can also put the DRM on the SD card and allow it to verify the authenticity of the game. That way you can have a physical, warrantied copy of your game. And not just a digital code that one day could be taken away from you for no reason other than, you don’t own it, haha, buy it again  if you wanna play. Not every game would have to be this way, but if PC gamers demand it, and Sony and Microsoft follow suit with their consoles, it could seriously change the gaming landscape, give gamers some power back.

I can understand why you  might say that about the top of the line Xbox Series X, it's good hardware but Microsoft's insistence on official NVME drives etc when the PS5 is open for using commodity parts makes PS5 the only choice at the $500 console point. BUT the Xbox Series S at the £250 mark lets you get a bit of hardware that will play the latest titles pretty well at a fraction of the cost of similarly capable PC (if not buying used).

Only downside I can see for most people is a lot of people don't take good care of their belongings (cracked phone screens, gunked up earbuds, dented car panels, etc.) and would then invest in a more expensive entertainment machine outfitted with their personal preference of hardware according to budget, only to not understand how thermal paste works or slot the GPU into the wrong PCIe rail and then blame PC culture for their lack of care regarding the machine they've invested in. I try to be optimistic but lets be honest. You can have years of good experiences with something but the moment it has a hiccup for a moment you feel like replacing it instead of troubleshooting it.

@user-cq6fk5go3s,2024-04-07T05:26:14Z,0,Microsoft’s choices on form factor and implementation of storage was just needless. It’s to me a feedback loop of stupid steps that’s created not needing to take the first step in the first place. Since there’s enough space for literally anything let’s use the 2230. Let’s make an expansion port to bandaid the first self inflicted limitation. Two capacity limited drives can now equal the capability of the one that should have been there in the first place. It’s easy just half the pcie lanes to make two slots out of one. Drives If you shoot your left foot just shoot the right one to compensate. Will pair nicely with the half capable drives chosen. Let’s sum up today’s meeting. We’ve chosen the worst layout to ensure the worst performance potential. If we can verify that it’s also the highest cost implementation possible to us then to the consumer let’s fork this one and celebrate by playing in traffic.,GgJj9Mok9dA,True

Plus, some games are optimized and just run better on console and the controller can be a better experience. BUT those are exceptions and not the rule.

 Eventually you'll see a 11th Gen XBox that is a mini pc, without any pc hassles that the cpu and gpu will be upgradable when you wish.
 The problem with current consoles is that they are still trying to reach a constant 4k/60 on all games.
 Still AAA has stood still for 4+ years with only CP2077 and that took 3 years to get out of beta form.

CPU: AMD R5-7600 - $200 (CPU Cooler Included)
MOBO: ASRock B650M-H/M.2+ - $100
RAM: Silicon Power 32GB DDR5-5600 - $80
GPU: ASRock Radeon RX 7700 XT Challenger OC 12GB - $400
SSD: TEAMGROUP MP44S 1TB PCIe4 NVMe - $60
PSU: Cooler Master G700 700 W 80+ Gold - $75
CASE: Deepcool MATREXX 40 - $45
INPUT: MSI FORGE GK100 RGB Gaming Combo - $28
Windows 10 Pro Key - $6

Total: $994

Average FPS in Far Cry 6 at 1440p according to TPU: ~120+

That's all-new parts, on the AM5 platform to ensure future upgradeability.  Instead of worrying about the fact that the motherboard only has two RAM slots, I just threw in 32GB.  I used AM5 just to prove a point, that you don't need to spend $1500 to build a good 1440p gaming PC.  BTW - This build would crush ANY current console as well as the PS5.  The R5-7600 and RX 7700 XT are an almost perfect match with both getting in the low 120s in Far Cry 6 at 1440p in TechPowerUp's charts.  This guarantees a balanced system which maximises gaming performance.  

TechPowerUp recommends a 550W PSU for the RX 7700 XT so the 700W Cooler Master G700 80+Gold-Certified leaves 150W of breathing room, which is a great amount since cards get more power efficient over the generations.  To give an example, 700W is currently what TechPowerUp recommends for the RX 7900 XT or RTX 4080 so the G700 will be more than adequate for this configuration with the 80+Gold certification as a nice bonus.  It's not a modular PSU but that doesn't matter since the DeepCool MATREXX 40 has a basement to hide all of the excess wires anyway.

There is nothing in this configuration that will not last for at least five years and there's plenty of breathing room for upgrades.

For expediency's sake, I ignored the other major advantage of PC building, the secondary market for used parts that can offer amazing value for the money.  Consoles simply don't have this because of their proprietary and disposable nature.  Hardware-wise, they are a BAD value, plain and simple.",GgJj9Mok9dA,True

@Marco-cg7fb,2024-04-06T12:36:42Z,1,"it's a really dumb subject, because the console manufactureres are able to sell the consoles at cost or even below, to get you into their ecosystem. The console ecosystem is hugely more expensive to be in than the pc ecosystem, a AAA game on pc is usually half to a third of the price of a console game, and they get progressivly cheaper with age, where as console games stay at their price forever. The consoles isnt about getting good gaming hardware at the price, but luring you in and making you pay a massive markup on games and peripherals. Also the current gen consoles are so damn out dated at this point they dont even play games at 1440p, the PS5 renders at something between 1080p and 1440p and upscales it to ""4k"", with really low to medium settings in games. 

The PS5 is somewhere around a gtx 1070 in performance, a card that was released over 6 years ago, and was only mid range back then. A budget PC is smashing a PS5 no issue, and it might be a bit more expensive up front end, but the games and everything else on the PC is way cheaper. COD is around 25-30 dollars on PC and 70 on PS5, once you've bought 5-15 games, the console is just about as expensive as a much better budget pc. 

10 games in which are on average 50 bucks more expensive on PS5 is a difference of 500 dollars, and that's 10 games in, imagine you buy 20-30 games on the PS5, you're gonna be up to a 1250-1750 dollar pc with the same games, it's as big of a factor as the front end price of the console itself.

I'm not a console hater, i've been playing on playstations since i was a kid, but you just can't compare the two price per price, when it's only a third of the equation. Also upgradeability on PC is a massive bonus, being able to stay up to date for as long as you want, with only a few components being switched out every so often. 

On a 5 year old console you'd have to give up your entire game arsenal when upgrading to a current gen console, having spent potentially a 1000 dollars on games in that time, is a massive slap in the face, which is a major reason not to get one, if you can afford the up front price of a pc setup.",GgJj9Mok9dA,True

Been noticing more graphics settings on console games now too but obviously isn’t as customizable. But then I play console and feel like I’m on a leash with multitasking and mods plus that fee to play multiplayer. Also gaming on console I run into so many guys who just group together on these sad clicks and hang out in the same party with more people in there than brain cells screaming on the mic. Plus the disadvantage of playing vs PC. 

Console only servers are fun to play in for shooters I find, not everyone is extremely pinpoint accurate.

I’d rather keep my pc and get a handheld RoG Ally or Legion Go, or wait for their 2nd lineup.

I play consoles with my nephews or friends when visiting then realize why I like pc more.

Love the dual sense though.

PS needs a pc gamepass instead of solo buys on steam, not that I want another subscription. Dual sense is nice to use on their PS steam games. 

It’s nice to not have to wait for the newest system or what it will look like or leave friends behind that can’t afford the next Gen. I’ve had my steam library since ‘08, some games are dead but at least they’re there or have mods and communities.",GgJj9Mok9dA,True

PC games ported from Playstation for example have launched terribly optimized and full of problems. As for the digital aspect: I hope people realize that if you own a console without a disc drive, your games library is living on borrowed time. Physical is the only way of preservation even though most of these games only have about half the game on the disc, it's still a copy of a license.

Upgrading from Xbox One X to Xbox Series X cost a lot less than the same incremental upgrade to my PC.

@simple3794,2024-04-06T00:43:05Z,0,"5 Reasons I prefer pc. For reference. I did play on console for a long time, only switched just a few years ago.

1. I love designing a pc, finding the parts, the prices, trying to min max the price to performance. I think it is really fun to play with the numbers and keep track of it.

2. The pc can do so much at a single time. I love doing a lot of things at a single time. My console could only run a game and spotify at the same time. If I needed to look something in a new game, I had to grab my phone or close the game. Being able to Tab out and find anything I need is a live saver.

3. I also use it outside of gaming, such as resume. I didnt build it fo doing work, but being able to is a outstanding quality of life improvement.

4. The culture around pc gaming seems a lot more strong/passionate just like Jay was saying. It all feels a lot more connected. Also competitive games feel so much more intense on a pc. I originally switched to play in game tournaments. The atmosphere on pc feels so much more intense.

5. Yes we dont get all console exclusives, but there are some games that are so much better on pc and only on pc. For example, Ark, Rust, CSGO, Val, Escape from Tarkov, Lethal company, ect,ect. Just so many titles that run better, or simply will never be on console.",GgJj9Mok9dA,True

@4b0d3,2024-04-06T00:23:35Z,0,"Comes down to what can play the games you want to play, when you want to play them/ at the fidelity you want to play them /for how long you want to play them.  Tried to offload all gaming to console for last 2 years.  First year was with a TV(hdr/4k/60/120) + console.  Hated sitting away from it, and standing close to a large tv felt like I was burning my eyes.  2nd year significantly less playing on a 32"" monitor 1440p where the console outputs 4k to 1440, it's weird, to get hdr to work.  felt silly, might as well just play on PC.

In that whole time I still had to play games on pc.. in that they were unavailable on console.

I like the console idea a lot, but I'll always have a pc.  Rather have a pc with gaming capability than a mini basic pc with a console.   The components in my current pc (6years old) are still more powerful than the consoles of today, and I only have to upgrade/build a-new due to win10 support ending.

The only thing I really want people to push for is actual gaming level monitors capping at 120 or 144hz and be 16:9 @ 40-45""  with freesync/software gsync and be reliable and probably IPS, oled is stupid.  I wouldn't get an ultrawide again, the increase to cost for what it is .. isn't worth it.  I use one for work and for personal.   Oh and no curve needed.

""Don't hook it up to a TV please""
It's quite a bit tiresome to keep hearing this same statement everywhere! 
Yes, expensive dedicated PC monitors are without a doubt better in terms of especially latency and such, but there are people (by people I obviously mean at least myself) who are very much enjoying their PC that they would have put a lot of time and effort into. not to say invested a lot of money into as well, but do not necessarily need the monitor to be designed for competitive gaming, because they think that their reflexes is fast enough to match the high performance of such a monitor when their wasting their lives on bulls**t like Counter Strike and what not.
I own a Samsung QE65Q70TAT, which delivers extremely good performance as well as supreme image quality! Pixel response time is more than good enough for me to have never noticed any kinds of ghosting in the image, not even compared with my brothers Asus Strix 'something', 165Hz. with 0,ridiculusly-fast response time. Which is more than just good enough for me!
And the last thing is, the hardware that I have installed in my PC, would not have been what it is if I would have had to buy such a PC monitor as well, prices on those things are enough to force a significant downgrade in PC hardware for my budget. Therefore I chose to do the very thing that is just universally agreed upon to be blasphemy when it comes to a high-end PC build, and I am for danm sure loving it!

- Oh, and I own both a high-end PC as well as a PS5, I love them both for their strong sides and what each does the best! And quess what? They're hooked up to the same danm TV.",GgJj9Mok9dA,True

The games for my PS5 however are currently exclusives that are not available on PC yet, I just haven't had time to game like that plus I enjoy streaming my gameplay on discord with my friends watching. For an adult, I would argue that making the investment in a custom built PC is far more worth it than a console. YES building PC's is addicting, I built two for myself (sold one), built one for my mom and built my best friends PC.

@Spidouz,2024-04-05T09:34:20Z,0,"I used to build PCs for a living in the ‘90s and ‘00s… now? I use Macs for work and I play on consoles, and I’ve never looked back. I’m just tired of the whole PC cycle of building, installing, troubleshooting, updating, debugging, upgrading, rise & repeat… in the end, it’s not cheaper than Macs, and consoles are so much easier and quality is good enough to play on your big ass TV in your living room. We still built a PC for my nephew, but only because he’s still young and have time to waste… it’s better that he learns it by himself. I’m too old for that shit, I’ve been using computer for pretty much 40 years now, used PC and Windows for the first 25 years and only Macs for the last 15 years… so I went through each evolutions, I got my hands dirty with PCs, so my choices are not by ignorance or any lack of knowledge. Au contrary, my choices are the result of too much knowledge about what I want and need… that’s why I didn’t hesitate to get 64GB RAM and a 8TB SSD on my MacBook Pro when I bought it… options that would cost as much as a full gamer PC… and yet that’s perfect for my work and I already paid it off. Ideally I dream of a MacBook Pro with M5 Ultra cpu, 256GB RAM and a 32TB internal SSD… even if it would cost me 10 grand it would be worth it for my work. It’s all about knowing your work needs and not saving pennies when every lost work hours would cost you more than the amount you would pay extra in the first place. So I would understand someone would build a 2+ grand gamer PC, just like I would get my Macs for work, it all depends on what you need. If you’re a serious gamer, PCs are not even a question.

@JustS0meK1dd,2024-04-05T09:11:36Z,0,"I will always have a gaming PC, and I have for the last 19 years or so. There are just too many games that are exclusive to PC, or better played with M&KB for me to drop the platform, and I really enjoy keeping up with hardware and building for other people as well as myself. However, I've found myself playing on my PS5 a lot more recently. There is something to be said for being able to crash on a sofa and fire up a game immediately that runs at 1440p 60fps with HDR (upscaled to 4k-ish) without having to mess with settings, or manually update drivers when a game releases. The performance, clarity and visuals aren't as good as I get on my PC, but thanks to the 12.5gb of usable memory the PS5 has, they don't usually have to cut back on textures too much, which is often the most impactful setting. It also helps that day one releases are often better optimised on console, so you aren't stuck waiting for patches to release for microstuttering or poor performance on specific hardware. A console really is a decent alternative to PC for some people (especially with the cost of hardware now), so I can see why some move to console when they no longer have as much time to invest in gaming.",GgJj9Mok9dA,True

Pc is expensive. 

Upgrading is not super worth it anymore. 

You can usually only upgrade within the same generation (intel) and by the time you do 3-5 years down the road the mid range cpu is better than your high end one. 

Sometimes you need new faster ram, So you could save the case and ssd and psu money. But in the grand scheme that very little savings. 

Now GPU is another game all together. 

Plus updates I just don’t have time to tinker anymore. 

I just want to get in play some games and get out. To windows credit they have made that better.

Pc cons:
Spend way more time tinkering with settings to find a sweet spot of quality and frames. I wish every game had a slider, set your desired fps at your current resolution,  and it should auto adjust all settings for you.

When the pc is off, nothing updates,  so you cant download/install that 50gb CoD update until you go to play it.

Very little time spent adjusting settings.
You can buy disc games and sell them after

@Gman2002,2024-04-04T17:06:39Z,0,"One significant aspect often overlooked in PC gaming is the need for patience during troubleshooting. When a game crashes to the desktop, individuals who lack technical expertise might not consider updating drivers, Windows, or BIOS, checking Windows logs or checking forums for similar issues. As a result, they may end up having a frustrating experience.

Whereas on console you press a button to turn it on and load the game that’s it. The hard part is done. There is a higher chance that the game will run properly on console versus PC.

For example if you have a bunch of buddies over and you purchase a game on Steam for a 4 player match and when you try to run it you get an error. That right there ruins the experience. You have to spend hours finding out is it your hardware, software or is it a known issue with the developer of the game. 

I have been building my own gaming PCs since 1998 and I still enjoy it. In fact I just built a 14900k with 4080 a few months ago.

All I’m saying is consoles these days are a great value for what they bring to the table. Some folks don’t have time to spend days or weeks troubleshooting hardware and software issues on a newly purchased game. They just want to install the game and play it immediately.

At the end of the day I prefer PCs as my go to due to forward and backward compatibility. I love the unlimited customization options and being able to relive older console gaming moments on emulators. The experience is breathtaking.",GgJj9Mok9dA,True

On console, you basically have the choice of playing the game and the ways the DEV wants you to or using a cheat device. PC on the other hand, you can always come up with your own. Want to use a controller when the dev didn't support it? You can get custom drivers to push the issue.... or even software like antimicro if there is no support at all! Want to play that PS3 game, you current Playstation can't? There's an emulator for that (and in fact Ive used these techniques to preserve multiple console libraries so they live well after the death of the hardware). Want online play for a game that only offers couch? Assuming Steam doesn't have you covered, you can get several programs to remote your screen to friends.

@hawkmoon3312,2024-04-04T09:39:36Z,0,"Well, I caught the PC building bug first in 1992, when I put my first Ad-lib card in my 286 pre-built. 95/96 was my first complete build, a 486/DX4-100. And I mean complete build. Sourcing the parts was really, really hard back then in Europ. There weren´t even stores back then, let alone the Internet. Luckily a friends dad was in Tech and had some wholesalers. Friend and myself build it. We were both 16 and both invested 2000 bucks and sold the thing for 5500. Which was a good price actually, for a complete high-end PC with all the bells and whistles.

Never looked back from that. After finishing school I immediately worked for a small PC store, building and repairing, later went into Server IT, worked for a wholesale PC builder for a while (literally building thousands and thousands of PCs) etc. 28 years later from that first complete build I´m selfemployed with my own little IT service. And I still love it. There were times I was fed up with building, I have to admit. Or better the rebuilding. I used to have fun swapping out coolers, re-applying paste, retesting thermals, overclocking etc. These days I´m too impatient and maybe will do a slight undervolt and conservative overclock and leave it at that, as long as it´s stable and playing games is fun and work stuff runs smooth, I´m fine with ""good enough"". But building from scratch still is fun. Though I´m too fast. Timed myself and the last full office PC (without gpu, just an i5 11400, 16gigs ram, 1TB ssd etc.) I built for a customer took me 14 minutes from opening the first box to boot-up. Of course just decent, normal cable management and no dGPU etc., but still. That I still love. And probably will to my dying day. I love all kinds of tinkering with electronics.",GgJj9Mok9dA,True

I spent about $1400, but $400 of that was for the Y60 case ($200), 5 RGB fans, and special cabling because normal cables in a glass case look horrible.

Off the top of my head, with quality budget pricing from Microcenter:
$100 - Windows 11
$320 - AMD 7600 + motherboard.  (Or 8600G CPU/APU)
$  70 - 16GB RAM (at least)
$  60 - 1TB SSD
$100 - 600watt PSU, Mouse and keyboard.
$  60 - decent case with 2 RGB fans
$710 total in basic parts.      

$225 = An RX 6600XT or RX 7600 will be on par with an PS5 and can do 1440P gaming quite well.  So just a bit over $900.

Free games on Epic Game launcher weekly, free and cheap games on Stream.
If someone has an older Windows 7, 8 or 10 key - they can get Windows 11 for free, so shave $100~150.

It doesn’t know how to shift between, an idle or a semi idle network activity and high priority wanted just put everything on the high priority one and then forget about the rest to download something while playing a game you’re download. Will go nowhere when you quit playing your game it won’t even notice that you quit so you’re down still be going nowhere This is another way that BSD on the PlayStation is better in every way I mean you’re talking UNIX a derivative of one of the original Berkeley units obviously highly customized for the PlayStation into Orvis but still Berkeley units under the hood so you know if you can stomach those things in the windows underneath the hood type operating system Then there are reasons to choose Xbox for other than gameplay but there’s definitely no reason to choose PC over one of them except that you may use your PC for other things that cannot be done on a console that require you know software applications you have to download and install, but as far as watching Netflix or using various apps, that shit has been available since the PS3 so that’s really not an argument my prime entertainment system is my PS five I don’t have cable I have Netflix I got Pluto and Tubi installed.

We just say hi Fidelity or FPS that’s our choicesand and mostly everything else is automatic whether you do or don’t have HDR for instance, if you have it automatically turn it on various things that have to do with your your monitor or your TV or whatever you have connected most of it’s automatic, I mean even the resolution by default is automatic you can go in and adjust you know what resolution you want to operate that but it’s automatically selected for you just like it is with any sop box or any other device using TV or a Monitor",GgJj9Mok9dA,True

I was in a deal with because I could see what they were casting I could cast interrupt them, and then cast on them my performance was so much better in that case on a modern game with high resolution graphics frame rate would be important obviously back then it was you know top down, you know symmetric 2-D graphics with 3-D sprites, and the only thing that really fucked you up would be like field spellsthat were animated but nowadays in a similar game, the graphics and the animations would be much more spectacular, taking up much of your processing so the frame rate would matter a lot but for most games frame rate doesn’t mean shit",GgJj9Mok9dA,True

The other one didn’t run right at all. Nothing I did worked correctly when I tried to move my character would move forward a little bit and attack wasn’t supposed to attack. It was just supposed to move. When I tried to shoot the radical would be over here pointed at something, but the fire from my weapons would go to the right over there. The bottom line is Xbox loads. Those old titles meant to run on old old hardware in an emulator otherwise they wouldn’t run at all. Most likely PlayStation just chooses not to let you run them. If you want to run something from the PS1 two or three era, you have to run it streamed, which means it gets free processed on virtual machines matching the requirements for that software, I tried it but I suspect that is a better environment than running your Xbox 360 and Xbox games on your series X I don’t know why you’d really want to I guess nostalgia maybe but those games are gonna look and run like shit no matter what you do because they’re old and they’re not running on the correct hardware And honestly it’s just a way for Xbox to pad their catalog their game pass catalog by putting there’s like 30 or 40 Xbox and Xbox 360 titles in the game pass catalog and the UV soft catalog is like 95 games only about 10 or 11 of them are Xbox one or Xbox series titles the rest are old hardware titles. Think about it, grab your Diablo title, grab that desk and put it in your PC install it and try to run out without you, making special provisions in your bio or elsewhere to adjust for the games, expecting a much slower clock, speed, and slower processors Invest the game run but you won’t be able to read anything because it’ll pop on the screen and pop. Also Fast I see that I’m playing destiny right now on my PS five and you get items popping up on the right side the screen like if you get an item it’s there so fast and gone so fast can’t even see what the fuck it is because there’s no accounting taken for that. It’s a PS4 client running on a much faster bit of hardwarethat used to be a horrible problem when you had an older game and you put it on a new computer NTC be starting all over the place depends on how the game was written and what processor, generation, and clock speed it was written for you really can’t play whole games on new hardware.

@darkguardian1314,2024-04-04T03:44:14Z,1,"One thing overlooked is the policies of the consoles vs PC. 
Short answer is to wait of the dust to settle on the current culture clash.
Playstation is talking about a new beefed-up console for PS5.  
XBOX has been going through a very public change after placing Sara Bond as President of XBOX. 
There's an eight strike system in place that will lead to suspensions to permabans of consoles as well as ALL you're Microsoft accounts connected to the XBOX. 
There is little recourse for appealing so if  your console is bricked. No one can use it and you will be locked out of Office and email etc. 
XBOX has a chip vulnerability but their security won't work with XBOX console owners but will work with PC owners. 
This was stated in a security video by Microsoft Tony Chen on how they treat console owners vs PC for the same issues. 
They treat PC as the victim because they may be hacked but consoles are treated more harshly as the attackers. 
There's a directive regarding character design which is optional (for now) but will likely be mandatory once the resistance settles down. 
It doesn't help that they also started an inclusive program for all their games with Mircrosoft Kelly putting out tweets that a change in culture at XBOX. 
Gamers are being disrespected and attacked despite paying for hardware and software totaling +$150 Billion last year and will go up to $300 Billion by 2027.  
Yet,. we're treated like children from gaming industry, games media, and government officials using gamers as means to push their viewpoints.",GgJj9Mok9dA,True

It just wasn’t up to spec to handle most of the games that are really popular games that were on it. Take on that dumb down horribly dumb down monster Hunter rise to run on the switch but yes, it’s a market that the console games can tap into and Microsoft has always. It’s always been their business model to run on everything and the reason they tried to create their own fucking phone market I mean they failed horribly Android and Apple that market and android specifically is not giving up market share so Microsoft you know gave up on that shit but they want if it runs it has a processor memory they want their shit to run on it that’s always been the case, so why would be any different Sony on the other hand being a smaller company I mean you think of Sony is being a giant and they are a giant but they’re $1 billion camp company versus Microsoft being $1 trillion Campise company they’re not in the same fucking hemisphere they don’t relate it’s like apples and steaks.

The PC market is shrinking even after a little bump during Covid where everybody was at home and they updated their PCs. The PC market has been for years shrinking size as consoles became more and more capable pieces became less and less necessary Right now the market share is roughly 50% mobile 30% consoles which you guessed at least roughly 20% PC the question of whether you suggest go all in on consoles for gaming is yes you can buy a fully capable gaming console for 600 bucks the equivalent PC is gonna cost you twice that or even more And then I can download install and run something without a hitch you download and install it and find out your drivers need to be updated or something not working right you have to fiddle with it for days to get it running correctly. Sometimes you can’t sometimes you gotta wait for the developer to put out a driver update to fix a problem, uncovered by some game or software I don’t have those issues, still playing games on PC is really the only real reason to do. It is for games that are only available on PC or two complex in the user interface. I know this is old but you take a game like all online mage combat couldn’t happen on a controller. There’s no way to do it. You have to have key bindings for all of your spells and and what not and you could not do it on a controller. There’s no way for a controller player to control a mage Effectively, in that kind of environment could the game be redesigned but it would yes but it would have to be redesigned across-the-board for everyone or gameplay would have to be kept separate between consoles and PC. Otherwise PC would just have way too much of an advantage so they are still in existence and new games being developed that will never be playable on a controller, so have have your fun play.

I bought a series so that I could test the various tears analyze the various tears of game pass to come to the conclusion the game pass is a fallacy PlayStation plus extra is still a far superior catalog And the PlayStation plus offering at tier 2 and tier 3 fire surpass game pass at the same two tears but I took it back to the store because I’m a PlayStation person if I buy an Xbox I want that one coming in November with 2 TB of storage and no optic drive because I’ve absolutely no usefor a wasted $80 piece of hardware in the consul",GgJj9Mok9dA,True

@tyrannicpuppy,2024-04-04T02:59:40Z,0,"5 reasons... can do. I am a console gamer and if I really think on it, these are the reasons why:

1: Familiarity. Our family (extended with uncles and the like) had the PS1 when we were kids. When we were out visiting family, most nights would end with Crash Bandicoot sessions in the shed or playing Time Crisis. Someone else made that choice back when I was too young to do so. When mum decided to splurge and buy us a game system, she naturally chose the PS2 coz it played the games we wanted/had and the controller was the same. It's what we were used to. And the few exclusives that we got for the system we then had made a bit of a lifetime commitment. Still have a PS3 hooked up to my TV so I can play all the Ratchet and Clank games.

2: Cost. There were 5 of us kids growing up. Console was way cheaper for us than PC. We had a PC too, but it was way lower spec (as we had a console why did we need a gaming PC as well). It was not playing anything truly demanding. It could not run Crysis. The games we played on it were still fun, but not the same as what we'd play on PS2. I'm Talking games like Zoombinis, Carmen Sandiego, Empire Earth, Red Faction, Need For Speed High Stakes... etc.

3: Convenience. When I moved out I was fairly broke. 2 Minute Noodles for every meal kind of budgeting. So buying or building a gaming PC was outside the realm of possibility for quite a while. But buying a cheap 32"" TV and a console was easy. And it fit in whatever crappy living situation I got myself. Be it in the bedroom, shared lounge, whatever.

4: Comfort. I love to kick back in the recliner and just enjoy my game. Most computer desk setups are not comfortable for me for long sessions. But I can play the console all day long and not be phased at all. Most folks have a lounge area that is really easy to add a console to. But adding a PC generally requires a more specific style of furniture and space.

5: It just works. I want to play a game I just grab the controller, sit down and play. I don't need to worry about drivers, software conflicts any of that stuff that comes part and parcel of a PC. Trying to play any older games on newer OSes can be a bloody nightmare. If I want to play Red Faction on my PS5 I just open the game and I'm playing. If I wanna play it on PC... it's a lot better than it was a decade ago, ironically. But there is still a level of faff involved in PC gaming that just isn't there with a console. And the update issue is hardly console exclusive. Every time I open Steam there are half a dozen games sitting there that need an update. I have auto-update turned on. If you know they need updating why are you waiting for my permission?!?! Just do it!

And after all those reasons, I will add that I also have a gaming PC with a 5950X and a 3090ti that I built myself a couple of years ago. I sometimes play games on it (using one of the controllers I own from my consoles usually, just prefer that interface). I also own the Xbox as well, even though our family did sit on the Sony side of that fence for the past two decades. But mostly, the PC is used as a media centre. It runs my Plex server and is where I access forums and other net based things outside gaming. Mouse and keyboard is still far better than controller for typing and browsing. I cannot stand this paradigm we're in right now where console games have a stupid floating cursor we slowly drag across the screen to select options in a list that could have just been selected using the D-pad. It's stupid and needs to die.

Horses for courses. Decades of being a console gamer means the PS5 is my go to if I wanna play a game. But the PC is where I go if I want to properly browse YouTube for example. The apps for most streamers are terrible. I sure wouldn't be writing this comment on the PS5. I can't convert my tv and movies to HEVC on the PS5. Each item has it's strengths and weaknesses. And if you can afford it, there is no reason to tie yourself to one brand or type. I'm lucky enough that these days I get a good bit of disposable cash to waste how I like. But if I was back to that fresh out of home state where my housing might be uncertain from one menth to the next, console definitely ticks more of the boxes for entertainment imo than PC. Even if a PC would be far more useful.",GgJj9Mok9dA,True

@amberphoenixfire3510,2024-04-04T02:48:17Z,0,"PC all the way.

1.  Modding - You want Baldur's gate 3 to feel even more like table top D&D add mods for random encounters and to let you level to 20.   Not happy with the looks of armors in Monster hunter, there are thousands of cosmetic mods for the layered armors, and so on for so many games.   It both extends replay ability, and customization of games that is just not an option with the limited few mod options some console allow for a limited selection of games.

2.  The games -  I myself love 4x and Grand Strategy games, and while watered down versions of come like civ are available on consoles, the best ones in Total War, Crusader Kings 3, Europa Unversalis 4 and so on are PC exclusive.

3.  The power -  Grant it getting into the extreme costs area of really high end PC's here but no console is going to run cyberpunk at over 100 frames per second max settings in 4k,  my PC can.

4.  Upgrades -  want a better GPU I can swap out, I want more Memory I can upgrade my ram sticks, I can upgrade my CPU if needed, along with hundreds of other upgrades I can do.

5.  Game/Online play cost -  While a PC itself may cost more upfront with steam sales and the like the games can often cost much less, and most consoles for any online play require you to pay for their online services.    I already pay for my internet connection so why should I have to pay more to log into playstaion+ or XBOX live just to use the online play functions in the games I bought.

@Guardian179,2024-04-03T21:23:06Z,0,"Oh, let's add a list of reasons for PC over console.
1.  You don't need a subscription to play multiplayer.  It's an archaic concept you still have to deal with on console with Xbox Gamepass and PS+.  While you CAN use gamepass on PC to have access to more games, you don't HAVE to in order to play multiplayer games.
2.  While PC is getting former console exclusives, the PC game catalogue is huge and has genres that aren't really represented on consoles.  I'm constantly seeing questions for games like ""when is it coming to console?"", and those of us that play on PC just laugh as the shoe is on the other foot.  Tactical shooters are pretty much exclusive to PC.  Tarkov, Ready or Not, Ground Branch, Arma 3, Squad, all PC exclusive.  Some have made the leap, like Arma Reforger, Hell Let Loose, and Insurgency Sandstorm, but it's rare.  Same goes for more hard core sims, like Xplane, DCS World, and iRacing.  You also get a ton of other indie studios taking risks on genres and concepts that they can't attempt on console.  Stuff like Doorkickers, No Plan B, Fox Hole, Cold Waters, Executive Assault, Star Citizen, and pretty much any RTS game are only on PC.
3.  Along with a limited library of games, you have a limited way of interacting with them on consoles.  On PC, I can use a console controller, a joystick and throttle, dual joysticks, rudder pedals, a wheel and pedals, and I have plenty of options to choose from.  I can use TrackIR or Tobii eye tracking.  I can use any number of VR headsets.
4.  During the launch of this latest generation of consoles, you had Cyberpunk 2077 exemplify why PC can be so much better.  They released it on the last gen, and the new gen of consoles, as well as on PC.  Because you can't really change settings on console, the Xbox One and PS4 had horrid experiences.  Meanwhile, PC players could just turn down settings to get a decent experience.
5.  PC games can often be had for cheaper, with more frequent and deeper sales.  You have sites like Humble that give you pretty good discount.

I like my PS5, I like the controller, and some of the exclusives.  But I'll play on my PC if given the chance.",GgJj9Mok9dA,True

The argument that console games are easier to optimize doesn't really hold too much water in recent years, plenty of launch titles that come to both platforms have unacceptable frame drops on both and launch day games that are console only have just as many problems as their PC counterparts.The argument really comes down to money and whether or not the added cost of a PC is balanced by it's functionality as a device that does other things or not and that's really up to the individual.

PC all day all night.
(1) Been building them since 1993 (Pentium 66 was my first build)  Used PC back to the 80386 chipsets since 1985 and in High school was messing with Sear and Roebuck sales people by writing Sears Smears while repeating on the display Commodore PET.
IBM Personal Computer 8080 was my first owned PC $1500 in 1980 was half a car price.  That was the Employees discounted Family price too.  My cousin Worked for IBM for 35 years as a Network engineer.  Dual 5-1/4"" FLOPPY DRIVE with 8MB RAM. What a rocket ship she was.
(2) Serious WW1 & WW2 flight sim enthusiast  HOTAS with Rudder pedals and TrackIR and VR
(3) Serious Space Sim Enthusiast HOSAS with rudder pedals and TrackIR moving soon to VR
(4) I like to build a ""Games only PC"" every three years and move the previous build to personal Servers for games such as IL-2, Rise of Flight, DCS, and Cliffs of Dover.  The previous Server PC 6 years old then gets moved to surfing PC for Youtube, apps and Emails ETC:
(5) I have such bad fingers and hands from work I can't use the paddle controllers of consoles with the fidelity I can for Joystick buttons.

Also if you take care of your console it will last. Obviously you need to clean it (like a pc). If you let your console overheating it will obviously die maybe only 5 years after getting it. 
What I think everyone should do is buy a PS5 and then a laptop for like 500$ (with an AMD CPU to get good battery life and a decent iGPU) and then you can use your PS5 to play all your games in 4K upscaled from 1440-1600p on the PS5 at 40-60 fps in a lot of games. Only rt modes are at 30 fps locked nowadays, and a lot of games have unlocked modes if you have a VRR TV (for example GoW Ragnarok 60fps mode runs at 80-100fps while unlocked, with the exact same graphics).
Obviously now that the PS5 is nearly 4 yo it's not the right time to buy it because it's only going to be getting games for 5 years. The only moment you should buy a PC is when you have like 1300-1500$ to spend only on your PC and you can get something that has a R5 7600, 32Gb ram and a 7800 XT for example, which is going to get you a better gaming experience than a PS5.

@fateless4439,2024-04-03T18:41:51Z,0,"I have been using consoles since the Atari consoles and have been building PC systems for almost as long. As such I believe I can speak on both sides of the discussion.

The following holds mostly true if one builds their own PC rather than buying pre-builts.

The one constant advantage that the PC (desktops, not laptops) has always had over the console, ever since consoles first started coming out, has been 'The PC Experience'. In the past decade consoles have attempted to bridge the gap by putting a lot of effort into creating and designing a console experience that would compete with the PC. Unfortunately, these efforts are doomed to fail because none of them correct the root causes of a console's disadvantages. The three main advantages that a PC has are: Usability, modularity, and personal expression.

Usability:
A console is mostly restricted to tasks pertaining to gaming/entertainment. A PC, on the other hand, is able to do SO much more. A PC is basically a one-stop solution for most of your needs, gaming or otherwise.

Modularity:
A PC has the ability to grow and evolve to your personal needs through several means: Software purchases, hardware upgrades, expansion capabilities, etc. As closed systems, consoles are extremely limited in this regard and tend to be locked into whatever came with your box when you purchased it.

Personal Expression:
With few exceptions, when someone purchases a console of a specific brand, my console looks like his console, looks like her console, looks like every other console of the name. Not so with a PC. Building a PC to your specific esthetical value is a level of self-expression that is very difficult to replicate on a console. That feeling of 'I built this. This is MY PC.' is not something most console users can experience.

In conclusion:
If you have the skill and the knowhow to build a PC nowadays, then you have no need for a console. If what you usually do is buy pre-built PCs or laptops which you only use for gaming/entertainment, then don't. Buy a console instead.",GgJj9Mok9dA,True

1.- PC's are way more powerful than any videogame console ever made, even more powerfull than what the brand new PS5 Pro will be (it was leaked)
2.- With a console you are indeed stuck with the configuration it was built, you cannot add RAM or upgrade the CPU or the GPU.
3.- PC's can use almost any console controllers, PS4/5 controllers, XBOX controllers, Nintendo Switch controllers, right out of the box, so you just have to buy a console controller and you are set.
4.- With a PC, you have a workstation and also a gaming platform at the same time
5.- That thing of exclusive games is BS, don't buy a console so you can play that exclusive game because if you do so, you are actually falling for those companies's trap. The best that could happen when a developer decides to launch, for example, a PS5 exclusive game is that only those that already have a PS5 buy the game (well, part of em, not everyone will like the game), so they get forced to release it for other platforms, don't let them build a monopoly around a console.

Our Xbox is connected to a 75"" 120hz 4k display.  

As for PC monitors, behave, another massive cash cow with inflated prices and an epeen fulfillment, there are 27"" PC monitors out there that cost more than a 43"" TV and do no better.  Currently it is cheaper to buy a 4k 120hz TV oled or Mini Led than a computer monitor. In fact you can pretty much get a 65"" 120hz+ 4k TV and a games console for the price of a decent 4k must have gaming monitor.

Plenty of PC gamers will not buy an Xbox simply due to the majority of game titles being available on PC.  A few I know are now at the stage they will not buy a PC, they are going for an Xbox and gamepass, some simply buying a Playstation. No one I currently know is planning on ever building a PC for gaming due to the costs of GPU's vs consoles.
The pricing of PC components is mental, and it's only continually increasing due to what people are willing to pay, it's nothing to do with production and development costs, we seen that when old stock changed from old prices to inflated new prices.

Look at it now,  you want to play 4k gaming at 120hz you need to sell a kidney and lung to build a PC full of Windows bloatware, or buy a £400 console. Sure the console won't have all the candy for your eyes. But for the price of the CPU most recommend for 4k gaming, you have a console and controller.

@heyyroo4625,2024-04-03T17:03:19Z,0,"I personally think the Xbox conversation is a bit more nuanced. I have 2 $4000ish PCs (at the time of building), a PS5, and an Xbox Series X. I typically play my Xbox more than my PS5. It’s in our bedroom and it’s easier to wind down while my wife reads or whatever. Love my PlayStation, but I have more friends on Xbox and a longer gaming history, so I have more to play there. Also, NOT every game for Xbox plays on the PC Xbox app. Not even a majority, honestly. I would argue that someone buying an Xbox as their first of the three isn’t a terrible idea because Gamepass is excellent and if they DO ever get a PC, a lot of their stuff can just be picked up where they left off on the console. I think exclusives play a big part as well, though. REALLY wanna play the Spider-Man games? Or both GoW games? Well, PS5 is the only option. To be fair, I LOVE my PCs and would always recommend to someone not on a super tight budget to go that route, but I think the conversation regarding the consoles IS more nuanced than we often make it. Also we can’t ignore the overwhelming amount of absolute trash PC version releases we’ve been seeing lately. Rarely does any amount of tinkering in settings make any reasonable difference considering it’s often development issues. Some games will get fixed over time (like I assume DD2 will) but other great games like Jedi Survivor seem to get left in PC port hell and forgotten.

@iBolski,2024-04-03T16:45:25Z,0,"I've owned consoles in the past (NES, Genesis, OG Xbox, Wii), but PC is always what I've used. Mainly because I've been a PC geek since my high school days on my Apple ][ computer where I self-taught myself to program, and it's why I'm in world of IT as a programmer/engineer to this day.

I don't hate consoles and I feel they should exist. Choice is always a good thing for anybody. But the top 5 reasons I am PC?

1. I love to tinker and build them, first and foremost. Built my first 386SX back in 1992, then a 486 DX/2 66 in 1994. As you stated, when it posts and works after you're done building it, there's no better feeling than that.

2. I feel if you shop and spend wisely, you can build a fairly good rig for gaming that lasts for years. Especially if you ensure you provide yourself a good upgrade path. In 2020, I spent $600 to replace my AMD Phenom II X3 720BE and GTX-560 GPU with a Ryzen 5 3600 and GTX-1660. New case, new memory, but SDDs and a 650W Gold Rated Corsair PSU that I had in my previous rig all came over which saved a ton of money. So with PC, you DO have that option when it is time to upgrade. You can possibly save money if some components can come over, especially if you purchased your components with future upgradability in mind.

3. I use my PC for more than just gaming. It's my media center, it's my programming rig, and I can install multiple OS's (such as Linux) if i want, or at the very least, run a VM. With the PC, I can continue to learn new technologies on my own time, and that allows me to grow professionally at work and has allowed me to move up in the ranks to where I am the SME and lead for all the apps that I support and develop for.

4. Kind of along the lines of item #2, but when I do build my PCs, I do make them last for a long time. Consoles have a new generation every 5 years or so, and they are NOT always backward compatible. For me, I love to play old retro games. With PC, you can make them work depending on the game. But with companies like GOG, they provide a great way to easily install a lot of older games that work on modern OSes these days. That's win-win and I am nostalgic with my old games from my childhood.

5. Finally for me, PCs are just fun for me. I still have an OG Xbox, but the DVD drive is going bad, and some games won't work well as it can't read the DVDs very well. With the PC, especially like GOG games, I can download the installers, back them up to an external hard drive for archiving, or burn to DVD, and I have access to them. And if something does go bad with my PC, I can more than likely replace it, whereas with consoles, that could be possibly depending on what needs replacing. But if it's a generation behind the latest release, it could be harder to get it fixed.

- Mods for games.Pretty much every PC game made that saw some success will have all sorts of mods made by game lovers, that can be like extra maps. special graphics, cheat modes... it is a whole world which adds lot that isn't available on consoles.
- A second hand PC that is still okay for all but the latest can be found for very little money, even some office PC can usually be turned into okay for gaming by just adding a modest GPU and speakers.
- Games for PC tend to be cheaper at launch than on console and they tend to drop in price faster as well.

Also, I cannot believe a tech channel legit used the excuse of ""Oh, but you have such diversity in hardware when it comes to PCs etc etc."" Yes, we do, which is why we got standards implemented, we got APIs implemented such as DirectX to keep all those diverse components in check.

For hardware, you ""could"" see the Pro versions like upgrading a GPU. $400 at launch, then 4ish years later has a pro, 7 years later a new console. Not saying this is better or anything, but it is something to think about for people with budgets etc as the console cycle has changed in the PS4 era onwards.

@RobCoops,2024-04-03T14:03:15Z,0,"I don't quite agree with the idea of being able to upgrade a PC to keep pace with the console releases. Having tried to keep up I can honestly say that if you buy a console beater today you are going to be ok to keep up with the next console generation that is just around the corner. But the release after that you will find that you cannot upgrade without a major investment in a new motherboard, new memory and a new CPU with of course a new GPU and all of a sudden you are spending well over twice what the new console costs. Keeping in mind that you already spend about half that to match the previous generation and twice the at the initial buy in and well you are spending way more for a PC than you would for a console.

Yes it is true that backwards compatibility is well hit and miss to say the best with consoles and is a lot better on PC. And the fact that you can relatively easily replace computer parts vs having to sent a console out for repair and hope for the best. A PC can be competitive if you are into the older games and or want to be able to continue playing your old games even years into the future.

But all in all I would say they are two very different beasts and a console is more for the pick up and play kind of players where a PC is more for the gamers that also want/need to do other things than just play games on the system. Think of doing your taxes, sending and receiving documents or even reproducing those documents on dead trees or making music and video's etc. It is the versatility of a PC that wins me over. I do also own the consoles just because well I am a gamer and I do like to play not just on a PC sometimes lying on the couch and just having a controller no keyboard or mouse is a just what I want.",GgJj9Mok9dA,True

I have both (consoles and PC) and it's an easier sell to my wife to upgrade the consoles because it's one and done and the whole family uses it.

Consoles are like and iPhone, for people who don't know how to use technology and  don't care about the fastest tech or like to tinker with settings. PCMR!

Consoles are better and more stream lined for gaming because its easier for devs to fine tune performance for a smaller sample of resolutions not upgradeable except for storage. I have already added a 4tb SSD in PS5 and 2tb on Xbox Series X. Another upside of consoles is there are less or no chances of being infected by a virus. Anyone think of anything else?

What if consoles were gone and devs focused all efforts to make there apps scalable in performance base on users resolution settings at any resolution  between ""800x600 - 15360 × 8640"" .  I currency game at a 3840x1600 ultrawide resolution  and have a 2nd 1440p monitor for content.

@bradstepford3307,2024-04-03T12:26:25Z,0,"As a PS5 and PC owner I can tell you missed a few things. No you can’t surf the web or do proper emails on a PS5, it has no web browser as Sony removed it. Sony doesn’t want anyone messing around with mods and such so they completely locked their console down and force people in to their little ecosystem. Sony also took away the ability to stream or send screenshots to our social media accounts. Now we have to create an account on the Sony app and log in to that than link it with our consoles and than we can pull files and send them whenever. This is all part of that forced ecosystem that Sony pushed on their users. I don’t use any of that as I refuse to support that nonsense. 
Most all games run at low/med settings when in native 4K, but cap at 30fps with terrible slideshow 1% lows. Anything above 30fps gets rendered at 1080/1440 with low settings than upscaled to 4K to target 120fps. No high end game has ever hit 120hz on the PS5 at 4K. Most all games bounce around 75-85fps including Gran Turismo which has horrible 1% lows. The console is running on the old RDNA2 architecture which is just terrible at high fidelity and high frames plus it’s only gen 1 ray tracing that completely bogs down any game you try to use it in. Most game can’t even use RT in game, Gran Turismo only uses RT in replays and picture mode and has no RT while racing. RE 2/3 turn in to a slideshow with RT on and you can’t beat final stage nemesis in high fidelity mode with RT on. He swats you every time and you have to play it in 1080p high fps mode to finish him off with zero RT when playing on nightmare or inferno difficulty. The HDR is also bad on the PS5 compared to pc or even Xbox. Sony used their own in house HDR format and it’s definitely a downgrade. We can get Dolby vision on Xbox and certain pc apps yet zero DV support on the PS5. This brings us to the audio which is terrible in the PS5. Again Sony decided to go in house and build their tempest 3D audio which uses phasing and amplitude to mimic surround sound but it only uses a 2 channel audio. It’s great for budget headset gaming, but not so much for full AVR setups with 11+ speakers including in ceiling speakers. Sony also had no Atmos support till last years update, this Atmos they gave us isn’t even real native Atmos. They simple made their 2 channel tempest audio trigger Atmos on our receivers. It sounds horrible and has an even worse dynamic range. Everything outputs in Atmos now even 2 channel movies and apps like Netflix that have standard 5.1 also light up Atmos. It was a brute force attempt at Atmos and they messed that up as well because Sony doesn’t want to pay the $4 licensing fee to Dolby laboratories. As for price, PC is most definitely cheaper in the long run. On PC we don’t pay membership fees to play online or to demo games. Currently you’d need PS plus premium to compete with pc level of service and that costs $200/yr cdn. Add that up over 5 years and you just paid for a 4070/4080 GPU while the rest of the console price paid for the rest of your pc. The days of consoles being cheaper are long gone, I went back to full time pc since Sony started pulling games off PSN. Cancelled my membership and moved on, pc is a much better experience and you can set it up just like a console. I turn on my rig and steam pops up as my home page/UI and best of all my PS5 controller is supported on steam fully wireless. Sony is gonna price themselves out of the market, they constantly raise their rates and pull games or lock them out on your m.2. They can’t even compete with the massive sales on steam, pretty hilarious buying uncharted on steam for $32 when it’s a Sony game that costs $60 on the PS5 lol.",GgJj9Mok9dA,True

I am 32, I remember at 7 I  went to my babysitters house for the first time and she told her son to go show me his play station. Which I thought was a room with an awesome setup where you can build forts and play with action figures and hot wheels... I was beyond disappointed when I saw this little grey box... And then he turned it on and the iconic PS1 opening played and I couldn't take my eyes off the screen the rest of the time I was there. And from that point until COD MW the original came out, I only played single player games. Which there was not very many MP games at this time to begin with. But that does mean I have played thousands of games up until that point. And I continued on console until The new COD MW came out 13 years later and that is when I switched to PC. 25 years of true gaming experience with 21 years of those being on console. There is some big learning curves. The biggest is switching from controller to keyboard and mouse. And when you are at a level where you are better than everyone you play with, and drop to scrub get good level... OMG it is a hard reality to swallow. I had to only use keyboard and mouse for MMOs and RPGs. Shooting games were not even an option without controller at first. But I got better. However, I am still better with controller. Game crashes will happen period. Which was never an issue on console, and the lats big learning curve I had was settings. When you know nothing, figuring out how to change your monitor refresh rate is complicated. And if you want mods that is an entire process, and if you want to overclock... Be ready to learn. There is so much more knowledge needed to do everything you can do and it can be very overwhelming when starting out.

@dalgrim,2024-04-03T10:48:38Z,0,"you forgot to mention this important fact: You will not find a more anti-consumer, money loving, corporate ideology than Sony! Their “support” is legendarily bad, their fee to play online is ridiculously high (9.99/mo aka $120/yr). This isn’t a game pass type where you get to play free games, ThIs is just to play the now $70/title game that you’ve purchased! PC does away with all of this. While it might cost more up front over a typical 5 year console lifespan you’ve saved money. Not only that PCs last nearly twice as long. With only a drop-in upgrade, a 10year old PC can still play the latest games. Yes you might have to use medium settings but even medium settings are usually on-par with console anyways. Now add the fact that you get keyboard and mouse option for controls (much better than a controller) and much better options like racing wheels with pedals, yokes and throttles for flight sims, etc. The experience is just better. Finally: mods…. There are some games that are simply unplayable without mods. There are also games that are still going 12 years after release date mainly because of mods. Again PC exclusive content. Want to surf the web? PC. Want to check e-mail? PC. Want to type a document for work/school? PC. Do your taxes? PC. In fact there are only two situations that I see a console as a good choice: You’re a parent and your 9-13yr old kid(s) want to play games with friends (in person, i.e. 2+ on the couch) OR you really only like fighting games. While PCs can play fighting games, they all need a controller and at that point a console at least breaks even with the PC in cost.",GgJj9Mok9dA,True

But a pc (without doing big upgrades) lasting longer then the console is not true. With a console you are guaranteed being able to play all triple A games for the next 8 years. You cant build a gaming pc and do this. The Xbox series X and PS5 released in 2020 and we are only half-way in this genaration. If you build a gaming pc in 2020 and did no upgrades like a new GPU its already an issue to play the new triple A games. Even the PS4 released in 2013 was able to get all the new games untill the end of 2022. Compare that with a gaming pc build in 2013 that never had upgrades. Also an important reason why some people take console over pc is because the are very limited on time to build a pc or troubleshoot; The just want to game. For me i have a PS5, Series X, gaming PC and no preference. My conclusion is that the PC has an advantage over the console, but that it is also much more expensive and you often need upgrades (such as a new CPU/GPU every 3 years if you want to be able to play the new triple A games.",GgJj9Mok9dA,True

@ckwi2245,2024-04-03T00:59:18Z,1,"Big point I think your argument glossed over in the PC Pros and Console Cons, Upgrade/Replace/Repair cost.  You really only mentioned the cost disparity at initial purchase, and it only remains a benefit if the cheaper parts break, if the CPU dies you about break even at the competitive range, and if the GPU dies you are most likely at a loss at the competitive range.  In this generation storage can be a wash if it's added storage, if it's built in storage that dies on console PC wins.  RAM or Motherboard dies PC wins flat out.

For between generation console upgrades (PS4 > PS5) it is probably cheaper to buy a PS5 than it is to upgrade a PC for the same hardware jump that would allow cross-platform games to play at at least the same quality.  Now for within a generation console upgrades (PS5 > PS5 Slim) I would say it's generally a loss.  But even for me who has all of the platforms, my main upgrade need is my 2070 needs to be replaced within the next few years, and at minimum that cost is 1.5X of buying a PS6.

Now for Longevity argument.  Yes, console generation is 5-7 years which is less time than any built PC can outlast, but for the price to maintain that duration, a PC has to play current games for 15-20 years to match the console replacement price.  And I don't mean it needs to be able to play 2024 games until 2044, I mean your 2024 PC needs to be able to play 2030 and 2040 games at parity with the hypothetical consoles of those generations at minimum to gain the cost advantage.  Any upgrades would work against that, and about the only way you can require personal PC upgrades for work in that time frame is if your work requires Arts Programs (Image Editors, Video Editors, Modeling Software, CAD, etc.), so for many writing off that cost as work necessary is off the table. And well, with this generation PC lost it's additional storage cost advantage, since console is now essentially at parity with PC for that now.

Now the only remaining computer hardware advancement has left are speed and power efficiency, since we have already effectively hit the Resolution Cap for CGI (think Movies, not Games here), it's just down to how fast can we render it.  Once that starts catching up in a meaningful way, I'm not sure which side of this ""fight"" that will favor, but I'm pretty sure console generations will start getting longer, and I would not be surprised if next Gen consoles begin after 2030 making this gen 10 years +.  Now at the end of the line PC will win, simply because the Cost to Performance ratio will eliminate the console market with simply Pre-Built PCs with little to no customization, i.e. think along the lines of Macs replace Consoles.  I would look to about 2050-2100 for the consoles to die out completely still though.",GgJj9Mok9dA,True

And you have all the windows features.. however with all of the background tasks that Windows has going you lose performance in gaming unless you turn all those things off. A console on the other hand strictly just runs games. I do think that they should make the Xbox operating system for the PC and make Windows available as an app on the Xbox store.

Have YOU ever built a PC using proper specing and parts compatibility research beforehand or just grab an off the shelf and go? I spent a few months doing R&D for my system checking databases to ensure maximum compatibility between parts. I even asked on forums about any issues. I probably doubt it. I also don't play hardcore AAA titles only as if they're the ONLY games in existence to justify I'm a PC gamer. I play a plathora of games from old to new. I have probably 1 AAA title and it kinda wore it's fun out long ago, namely AC Valhalla. To me anymore it's kinda dull. My lesser titles are actually more fun and get more replay. I'll replay the hated and critically panned Metal Gear Survive more than AC Valhalla because it's actually fun. Cheesy, but fun.

PC parts being replaceable isn't even a bad thing. But at least if needed, I can drop my NVME drive into a new system, fire it up, and continue on. If a part goes south, I fix it and move along.

If a console hardware part goes dead, the system is dead. I don't have the time, resources, and money, nor the patience to unsolder parts, replace them, solder them back on, pray to the gaming gods the new hardware works and something else isn't borked, and hope it works. If my 5700XT goes dead, I just replace it with a 7800XT, and the Linux kernel, libdrm, X11, and Mesa do all the rest of the work for me, and I know PC parts with maintenance can last 5-10 years, 7 on average.",GgJj9Mok9dA,True

I have a mix of both BlueRay and digital, but I like the security of a physical disk more so the brunt of my collection is on disk. Because if something happens they can't sneak in and delete my hard copy BlueRays like they can with digital media. If they wanted to Google could go into my account without rhyme or reason and delete all of the digital copies of movies I bought over the years.

Xbox has realized this and went the way of implementing themselves on all systems. 

Sony hasn’t caught this yet. Sony has actually really boned themselves. Considering they put the majority of their exclusives on PC (or are coming) they kinda dont have much going for them. Their streaming service has issues, you have to pay to be online, you cant mod or really customize much game wise or even console wise. Anyone with a PS5 knows what i mean. Remember on PS3 how you could fully customize your XMB? Cant do that now. 

Console does that its designed to do as long as you’re ok being stuck in the parameters that the manufacturer makes for you. 

PC on the other hand is like being set free after being in Jail. You get all your options back, you get customizability, mods, themes, you can build, create, edit and tweak anything you want on pretty much anything. 

It took me years to take the expensive jump to PC but it was 100% worth it, and the Bug you mention about wanting to build is 1000% true. You feel a sense of accomplishment when you sit back and see what you’ve built. Rather it be low, mid or high tier it doesn’t matter. You made it, that sense of pride in yourself becomes really infections and important to mental health as well. 

If you have a friend with a lot of PC parts, ask if you can build one. It’ll change your outlook once you’d done it for yourself.

My only argument would be if you’re a Nintendo fan. Nintendo is still doing there thing and buying a switch would be worth it for you. Thats assuming you love the big 3 that they provide.",GgJj9Mok9dA,True

@viraxclone,2024-04-02T20:34:56Z,0,"Meanwhile, I'm spending this year buying all the generations of consoles and games that I used to have/wanted to have. Just recently I acquired an NES, PS3 and two of every GameBoy, minus the micro (Mod one, stock for the other). I never owned a PS3, but there are so many good titles on it that I have loved on the PC, but I want to experience it on the console. It seems that the console market has tanked a bit, and now is a great time to buy older games. I'm finding PlayStation, PS2, PS3, XBOX, XBOX 360 and gameboy games dirt cheap. Anything vintage like NES and SNES is staying up there in value.

The problem I see with PC and the digital media market, is you never know when it's going to be removed. Steam has been known to remove old titles without notice, leaving users unable to play that title again. I love the cartridge generation consoles, and I relive my teenage years with the optical disc media of PS1, PS2 and XBOX. My kids are loving the experience of playing on each individual console and it's quirks, but seeing them get as much enjoyment out of the physical media and the artwork with it is really rewarding.

Then there is the challenge of trying to store everything....Now I have several LARGE hard cases similar to pelican cases, to foam up and fit for all of the consoles, so they can be safely stored and conveniently retrieved an setup when we get the itch to setup and play one of them. Space constraints start to kick in and you have to limit how much STUFF you get, including games, where as with digital you can store thousands of titles on a single media type, and it not take up more than 5"" of space.

There are trade offs for both, I play both for the experience of playing original hardware, and yes, I even have DOS and Windows 9x/XP systems on standby for nostalgia, but I love to experience it the way it was intended to be on launch day, or at the very least, how I remember it.

Buy what makes you love the act of gaming, what gives you the excitement of ownership and gameplay. I don't get excited when I play a SEGA GameGear, or Saturn, or PS4/PS5. My XBOX One S is literally just a fancy netflix/plex box that the kids use a few times a year to play minecraft on when they are bored. Pull out the NES, Genesis, any GameBoy, or early Playstation and the experience and activity becomes exciting and something to look forward too around here.",GgJj9Mok9dA,True

@hassosigbjoernson5738,2024-04-02T19:40:36Z,0,"I think the small XBox Series X is very underrated!
Everyone is talking about: ""but you can also play it on PC!"" ... BUT not for the price!
For me the Series X is like a very affordable, mini gaming PC! I got mine for 350 bucks used, roughly one year old, roughly 18 months back. It loads fast, it's compact, quiet and runs a ton of games. With a 2TB NVme SSD via USB 3 (Crucial X8) I also have enough storage and it transfers data with 2.7 GB/s+. Fast enough I would say.

Although I do have an older, midrange gaming PC, I really enjoy this little Box. And the current announcements from Phil Spenser with EPIC and more coming to XBox are just underlining my experience: I have no trouble in finding games, let it be Game Pass or Ubisoft+ for new titles.
And after all: I do have Sony games like Horizon 1+2 on my list as well ... And I'm going to buy it on PC eventually.

But not only as a first gaming device ... also as a second device for me it works really well so far and I have been enjoying much more games from my pile of shame since I got it (like Subnautica, AC: Origins, RDR2, Forza Horizon 4+5, AC: Mirage ...)

For me it IS a mini PC ... but preconfigured and ready to roll out of the box. No RGB, no research, no matching configuration, no installation ... it just works and I use the time for gaming.

And I guess ... it's a similar story with a PS5 (obviously without the PC/XBox games and a bit more expensive).
Microsoft should have advertised it as a preconfigured mini PC. And something like a Steam OS on XBox would suit this little box quiet well. 

p.s. And I really like that used market with all these game disks. It may be out of date ... but it's fun for me! And a bit relaxing to know I can take my time with an open world game knowing there isn't a subscription running just for one game and if I don't like it/ have finished I can resell the game. It's kinda nice to have the option.",GgJj9Mok9dA,True

@Aisaaax,2024-04-02T19:32:44Z,0,"My opinion always was:
If money is not an issue - buy a good gaming PC + console for exclusives only.
In all other cases, If you don't need a powerful PC for productivity and enjoy games - then get a cheaper laptop for web browsing etc +  console.

Mid-range gaming PC's are simply not worth it for gaming. They cost several times more and offer pretty much the same quality as PS5. 
I never understood the tribalism and elitism in a gaming space. Herewe have PC Master Race who think all console gamers are losers. And th the other corner we have consolewarriors that are frothing at the mouth trying to prove how much better console is. 

And just... Dude. PC is a tool. You can work on it AND you can play, but because of that it costs waaaaay more per fps. If you only play - it makes zero sense unless you actually invest in a PC that has noticeably better graphics. 
Same for console - it is great entertainment value. But if you need productivity - you have to have a PC anyway, so value proposition of a console gets reduced. Or if you have money for it - a top-end PC will always be better.

Also, on the topic of passion. I've built probably 5 or 6 PC's over the years, and am about to build another one this weekend. And EVERY TIME it was nothing but an annoying hassle that I force myself to go through. It is easy to do. But for me it is completely unfun, chosing all the components is a chore, building PC is a chore, installing all the necessary software and turning XMP and so on - is a chore.
I'm sure some people feel DIY passion about it... but not all of us. And BTW this is not for the lack of knowledge - I've build PC's since school and is a software developer. I just don't feel that PC building is any fun at all.",GgJj9Mok9dA,True

- mouse and keyboard, sitting at a desk. I never, ever was able to handle a controller to save my life. Not to mention games that would not allow inverting the Y axis (like Halo!). 
- the higher cost of hardware was quickly offset by the price of games. 30 bucks for a new PC game, versus 60 to 80 for the same game on console. 5 games later, I've recouped the price difference AND had the better hardware for playing them. Not so sure that's still true - PC versions are now expensive, and digital / subscription based gaming is something I've avoided. 
I hate being beholden to an online provider, who might pull the plug on my favorite game at any moment. I now have a 1200 game library, ALL of which I can still play on my current PC, which means I'm too invested in my old-school setup to ever consider a console now. 

I'd also add ""mods"" as a historic PC benefit. At a time when consoles could not. Including the ability to hack around in config files.

@CloudyMcRowdy,2024-04-02T17:22:28Z,0,"youve left out a LOT on the PC side of the argument, and a lot of the negatives about console, out of the argument as well.
 For instance, multi-tasking on a console is nearly impossible. Multi-monitor setups in which you can use the monitors for separate tasks, is impossible. Consoles also target 4k texture resolution, not native. You can absolutely build a pc dollar for dollar to out-perform a console. The only time a console will win in that battle,  is how 30fps feels. People arent ever comparing 30fps to 30fps. People expect steady 60 out of a pc, all the time. Whereas consoles rarely put out 60, and even more rarely put out higher than that. On a computer, a few settings can be changed and you will be running the same game at a higher refresh rate, at the same overall price, every single time.

I do agree that consoles are closing the gap, and becoming more competitive.. But this is not the first generation theyve tried to close the gap, and it will be a few more until a console comes anywhere near a computers abilities. But we havent even started on competitive gaming, or input lag.

I've also found that my gaming experience on titles available on both platforms is better on a pc... let's take MW3 or Fortnight for examples. I do mush better with mouse and keyboard than I do with a controller.  I know that's largely because I don't put in the time on controllers, but I'm just more comfortable with a keyboard and mouse.  
I guess it comes down to this... when the next PS I may or may not buy one, but I'm currently planning on building a new pc within the next year as my current one is closing in on six years old and struggling to keep up the FPS in DCS.

@bealight5141,2024-04-02T16:08:52Z,0,"There are some massive massive downsides to pc. Its easy to buy a pc and play a game, but It can honestly take you days to get your system dialed in for a specific game. Almost nothing just loads up and plays without needing tweaks, keybinds, configs, etc. If you want to be competitive in a game like apex, there are so many settings and configs etc that you need to understand and it changes every update so you need to watch youtubers to stay current. DirectX11 version is stuttering bad after the update? Do you know how to switch to DirectX12? If not, you'll be at a massive disadvantage to everyone that knows and already switched. Oh now in this new update theres no stutters but DirectX11 version has significantly lower input lag this season. So if you're still using DX12 you're at a disadvantage.

Point being, there are a lot of people that want pc so they can ""get better at apex"". I never discourage people, I just make sure they know that making the switch to mouse and keyboard will be the easiest part of the transition. Also its good for people to know that controller is not viable on pc for competitive games. The sooner people come to terms with that, the sooner we stop seeing so many cheaters in all the popular games. A solid HALF of the cheaters on pc are people who came from console, still use controller, and are upset that they cant compete like they used to when everyone was laid back on a couch.",GgJj9Mok9dA,True

Consoles cons for me are the game pricing and game availability , on the PC side we have strong discounted sales, you can forget that on console. Since MS and Sony have started bringing over their titles i've not had much of a reason to buy them anymore tho. That and my changed taste in what I play (more and more indie) means that there is not much on the console side for me anymore. That said, even if PC building has become much more friendly (looking at you DMA/IRQ jumpers) from when I started. I can still totally see why someone would go for a console.",GgJj9Mok9dA,True

@LargeStyle,2024-04-02T15:25:52Z,0,"Regarding PCs price ""negative"" as mentioned in the video, I think that while that viewpoint is numerically understandable, that might be an oversight of practical benefit. Not only can PCs run at uncompromised settings beyond console, the console exclusive arguement is (conditionally if not factoring in Nintendo) actually reversed nowadays as there's few console exclusives around and loads of exclusive sims (mainly racing and flight) on PC along with more enthusiast genres such as hardcore RTS's or survival types, not to mention a bigger indie scene too. PC is also a must if you're a VR enthusiast not only for those sims, but for modding into non-VR titles and even retro gaming (via EmuVR to name but one). PCs are a must if you want to run most (but admittedly not all) enthusiast grade peripherals. Further factor in that PC has support for early access builds along with complete backwards compatibility for your entire games library no matter how old. On top of that, PC's not only cover any work aspects but also support hobbies (I like to write music) or simply any other practical application and it's covered.

So all considered, there's still a very strong argument to say that despite the high entry costs of PCs, they have and offer so much value compared to a singluar generation closed platform mainstream only gaming machine. I've had every Playstation and a few Xboxes and I try to be a console gamer, especially nowadays being 46 as all I want is quick and easy (cough) but I always keep coming back to PC as consoles feel like too much of both a step down and backward in terms of functionality, and consoles just don't ""simply work"" if they literally can't play the games either in the way or quality that I'd like to play them in. I'll always have a Playstation on the side for what exclusives there are (like GT7 right now) but my main platform is and probably always will be PC.",GgJj9Mok9dA,True

Clearly PCs then, even factoring in bootleg titles, were far more expensive.  With the original Xbox it was clear consoles were moving into the same space as PCs, but likely sold at a loss for hardware, and substantially making up for it in title cost.  Consoles were no longer the budget option.

@ETHPrivate,2024-04-02T14:46:50Z,0,"My 5 reasons for owning a PC:
1. It's open, nobody owns the 'PC' ecosystem. (If you say Windows I want to remind you that Linux and by proxy SteamOS are great alternatives if you're willing to get your feet wet)
2. It's very easy to expand your storage both internally and externally
3. It doesn't matter if you prefer controller or keyboard and mouse, you can use both
4. You can really get into your graphical settings and tweak them to your liking, while most console games only have performance and fidelity mode
5. Playing games online is free

My 5 reasons for owning a Xbox Series console:
1. The value of the Series S, assuming you don't mind going all digital, you can get a console that has lasted 5 years for only 300 dollars
2. Game Pass, while on PC as well, still retains most of its value on console, and gives you a huge collection of games to play at no additional cost
3. A huge library of games from all Xbox generations, all upscaled, auto HDR support, more stable framerate or even double framerate with FPS Boost
4. Uuuuhhhhh...
5. Rare Replay?

My 5 reasons for owning a Playstation 5:
1. A beefy (but declining) list of exclusive blockbusters
2. One of the, if not the most comfortable controllers
3. Damnit this is hard...
4. I mean even if nobody is buying Xbox consoles, Microsoft is still pushing publishers to give up exclusivity...
5. Do Xbox players even play Persona 3 Reload?

My 5 reasons for owning a Nintendo Switch:
1. Mario Kart 8 Deluxe
2. Animal Crossing New Horizons
3. Super Mario Odyssey
4. The Legend of Zelda BOTW/TOTK

There's no incentive to buy a console.. but I guess they do say it's the software that makes them money, not the hardware. I used to be heavily console oriented.. but the reason was not because they were like a PC, it was because they were SIMPLE. No menu's, no updates, no storage. You put the game in, turn it on, the logo pops up and you play. I stopped being a serious console junkie around the time of the 'online' consoles, the last generation for me that was really worth the bother was PS3 and Gamecube. Granted the issue still persists with the Switch, but at least Nintendo has it's IP's that are not available on PC. So in a nutshell, why would I want a 'mini-PC' hooked up to my TV when I have a PC already? My top 5 reasons for going PC, 1: PC can do everything I need (often at the same time) 2: PC is upgradable in every aspect 3: While gaming with a controller is great, menu's and everything else are far quicker, easier and more responsive with a KB and Mouse. 4: I'm lazy af, I really don't want to get out of my chair, head over to the other room and turn on my TV and console to play something I can play without getting up. 5 I don't like the way digital only gaming, DRM's, forced arbitration, eula's etc are going in the gaming world, at least on PC there's always ways around certain issues.. consoles are extremely difficult to mod now.",GgJj9Mok9dA,True

2) The quality of the components and accessories like controllers are garbage. I have stick drift already on an official xbox controller with less than 100 hours use.

The switch just feels great playing old school 2D games.  I started out on Nintendo and PC. At the time, each had a different set of games that you couldn't get on the other. Nintendo had Mario and companies like Sierra, Broederbond, The Adventure Company, Apogee and Dynamix published great games on PC. It wasn't until the Atari Jaguar where I saw PC games make it to a gaming console. I think it was Wolfenstein 3D and maybe DOOM I.  Games like Quake 64 and Duke Nukem made their way to Nintendo 64 but those ports were vastly different from the PC versions. It reminds me of how vastly different the Ghost Recon Series was on PC vs Xbox.
Throughout my military career, I stuck with a gaming laptop as that seemed the most viable option as I was always moving around or going overseas. After I got out of the military, I settled down on Xbox 360 for a while and eventually moved to PlayStation 4 due to the horrible Xbox 2013 launch. Slowly, I've made my way back to PC.

Another advantage of having PC are mods. You can just have better graphics by adding mods into your favorite game or mod your character completely (ask FF XIV players).

2) I can’t justify spending $700-$800 on a console just for gaming, but even if I spend $5k on a pc that I can do everything on I feel it is worth it for example like a workstation. So you can do business as well as game.
3) I can overbuild a PC and write it off as a business expense and claim all the GST as well as claim the full amount off my tax, in Australia a computer is 100% tax deductible, where as a console is not. So for me it’s a no brainer.",GgJj9Mok9dA,True

Popular ones eventually get ported to PS4/5 and Switch, but they are PC first, and PC gets updates way faster due to the console verification steps.  SteamDeck for me is the optimal console choice to go along with my desktop.  Not having to re-buy my collection of games is a big benefit to stick with PC.  This is in addition to the freedom that you get on PC, and the aforementioned stuff like full OBS, emulation and modding without getting banned, utility software, ad-block and other privacy tools.  The option to use keyboard and mouse, or play games that do not have controller support and thus require keyboard and mouse is also a big boost to PC.

@FrancisNadal7,2024-04-02T13:06:51Z,0,"Let me preface:

1. I haven't been a ""gamer"" for that long.
2. I built my first gaming pc last 2020 (Ryzen 5 3600 + 2060 super).
3. My lovely wife surprised me a PS5 just this January this year. It is our 1st console.
4. PC vs Console is idiotic.
5. I dunno why I act like my TwoCents is worth anything but I'm gonna share my thoughts anyway.

I am in love first and foremost to my PC, it has been from blood, sweat, and tears building that. I've been gaming on that mainly playing Apex Legends and streaming to a measly 1-2 audience and 1 of them is my cousin lol. Played CyberPunk 2077, The Witcher Wild Hunt, Horizon Zero Dawn. It has provided me with so much joy. But I'm not that young and there's a lot of responsibilities. From playing every weekend, to once a month, and to never played for months. It was heartbreaking. I just couldn't find the time to dedicate playing on PC. There's also a problem where we can't play together with my wife. Sure there are games and ways to play together, it's just isn't that easy over a console. And there's disctractions too like YouTube, Facebook, Reddit, etc.

But with our PS5, I can just boot up a game and not have to think of anything elese. It's an absolute joy playing with my wife, Sackboy, It Takes Two, Overcooked (god this game is testing us!). Then there's the games I also absolutely want to play like Forbidden West, God of War, Ghost of Tsushima, The Last of Us, which funny enough are also starting to be available in PC. My main point is I could easily go in and out of the games. No matter if I could only play an hour or two, its just so easy with a console. The best reason is my wife and I could bond over eitheer we play together or she watches me play the games I like.",GgJj9Mok9dA,True
@Bav92,2024-04-02T13:05:30Z,0,I thought PlayStation said their games are also all on PC now. So there is no reason for either one unless you really don’t have money. I would say getting a game to run on PC definitely takes more effort than just one button tap like on console.,GgJj9Mok9dA,True

No question that PC is best for frame rates and graphics as long as you have not bought a potato but.. I decided to try a console because I kinda had enough of buying games and spending  more time with settings than actually playing the game and then new drivers out and things might not work as before. Recently COD stopped working for me and no matter what i have tried nothing worked so i had to reintall windows.  For concole I went with an xbox because it has more games that support mouse and keyboard and that you can play gamepass games on pc also. I love how easy it is to jump into a game. Yes you can just have gamepass on pc only but again sometimes you can have issues, I had issues with games on gamepass not upgrading correctly on pc so instead of spending hours trying to solve the issue I was just jumping on xbox. The prices on xbox for games is a minus and also the gamepass subscription but they are ways to get gamepass cheaper. I have no experience with PS5 but the fact that less games support mouse and keyboard and the prices of games and subscription is higher put me off from getting one. One pig plus for PC gaming is steam and the massive sales thay have all the time. Only a handful of games I paid full price, most of my games collection is from sales.",GgJj9Mok9dA,True

So it was either buy a ps5, or spend a lot more money  and build a PC that is faster and more powerful than even the ps5. 

I did not hear about Microsoft ditching the Xbox considering they are the only real competition for PlayStation. A Nintendo system is needed if you want to play Mario though, that is a better system for children.

If you compare the price to performance of the off the shelf high end brands like ROG or whatever of course console is better but if you take time to get the deals and especially if you use your gaming setup for ANY thing else.. it's well above and beyond worth building a gaming PC.

Can you play on console without a TV? Nobody ever talks about the TV costs with the console. ""Because I already have a TV"".

Exactly! And unless you are buying your first PC, yes you buy a monitor, a keyboard, mouse, speakers/headset - and its expensive. But the next time, you are just upgrading parts.
Buy a little overspec, and your upgrade cycle is much more affordable.

If you buy a AMD 7000 chip today, and upgrade it to a 11000 chip in 4 years time, you will probably still be using the same mobo, RAM, storage, and cooler. Your PC will feel almost as new, for the price of a whole new console lol.

That GPU you bought and upgraded? Who else can use that GPU?
I put my 'old' GPUs in a computer behind the TV for couch gaming. Or its an upgrade for the kids - or the waifu PC. GTX 1080 Ti - works just fiiiine for any modern game on a 1080p monitor for the kids. Even my old i7-4770K with a 2060 regular is STILL a good homework PC for programming...

PC is fine as long as you don't join the arms race of buying ever more expensive hardware to try to run everything on ultra settings and high resolution, recklessly enabling extremely demanding settings for very little return. This is the easiest path to get burned out.

PS5 is doing better where I can play without the patch, but there's still not the whole game on that disc, and there's something else that needs to be downloaded over the internet. 

So I have an Xbox Series X sitting on the shelf and it's useless. Because I'm tired of taking it home, installing a game, getting the game verified and then taking it back

@Celis.C,2024-04-02T09:48:33Z,0,"Last month I caved. Bar the GPU, the prices for all other parts weren't going to get cheaper. So I ended up overspending heavily because of the GPU alone, but I'd been biding my time to upgrade for 3 years and started running into unacceptable FPS in some games with my good old gtx 1080.
While I picked all the parts for my new system, I still had it assembled by the store I bought it all from. There are some major benefits for me to doing that, instead of building it myself:
- Warranty: if anything goes wrong, the costs are not for me
- Compatibility: I did do checks to the best of my knowledge, but the assembling service double checks it all for you. Turned out my CPU air cooler was too big for my already big case and wouldn't fit because of the higher profile RAM; the devil's in the details. They also update the bios, the drivers and can install the OS for you.
- Saving me headaches from devilish details. Turns out the RGB fans I picked for a push-pull config were going to be upside down in 2/3 of locations. I had to get the reverse-blade version, which were only available in single fan packages instead of a 3-pack, so they also did not include an RGB controller. And while the AIO cooler I picked instead of the air cooler did come with a controller, that somehow wouldn't work with the additional fans (all Lian LI). And while the Lian Li case also came with a controller, that only worked for the case RGB. RGB is a massively problematic area that is sorely un-optimized, also because I ended up having to up 4 different pieces of software to address them all and somehow not all adjusted profiles get saved properly if I turn off my system for maintenance / vacation periods.

My only console is the Switch, which is notoriously fragile. I had to replace a joystick on a Joycon within a few months and recently had to RMA the pro controller within a year because of a drifting joystick. And the Switch itself feels FLIMSY as heck, especially compared to my good old GBC/GBA. They just don't make them like that anymore.

@SuperSonicGamer763,2024-04-02T09:47:49Z,0,"I started on console and then built my first PC in 2014. Sadly, my choice of an FX-8350 meant any CPU upgrade would require new motherboard (as Intel was the better option, at the time, for forward compatibility).

While I learned a lot and definitely got bit by the PC bug (I built a PC for both my brothers and essentially became the PC repairman for my friends and family) I got discouraged and didn't want to sink money into a new MB and CPU, so I ultimately ended up going back to consoles.

I  was going to try my hand at a new build in 2020... we all know what happened to PC parts then. 

Then the Steam Deck released and that was a game changer. I was suddenly engaged with tinkering with a system and games to get an experience I felt was optimal and I was re-exposed to the fantastic Steam ecosystem (which had significantly improved with funtions like Remote Play Together and a new UI).

Suffice to say, the Steam Deck was the gateway drug that led me to finally building a new PC two weeks ago. That, and the precarious geopolitical situation with Taiwan that could potentially grow into something that would cause PC parts to skyrocket in price.

I'm hooked once again! As a Series X and PS5 owner, I'm floored by how much better games can look. Then again, they should look better, as my machine is on the high-end side. But my brother had me help him build a new mid-range PC alongside mine and I'm pretty impressed by that thing's performance.

Also, with Steam Big Picture mode, I completely disagree with Jay on using your PC on a TV! I use mine on both, although I am still using my old 144Hz 1080P Ben-Q TN-Panel from my first PC build, as a new monitor is not in the current budget. On my LG CX OLED (a 4 year old TV) games run fantastic with at 120fps, HDR, and VRR. Sure, latency would be better on a monitor, but if you're playing with a controller then on a TV you're essentially getting the console-extreme experience and it is glorious! Besides, I think you're getting a lot more benefit from the 4K resolution on a larger display.

Overall, if your friends are invested in a particular console ecosystem and you're on a budget or ease of use is a primary concern, then go with a console. If you want a more customized experience, upgradeable experience, or have need for a machine to do work on, then go with PC. Just make sure you consider forwards compatibility when choosing a motherboard and CPU (and PSU, to an extent) if you don't want to have to practically swap out everything. And if you'd like to test the waters with the PC market without breaking the bank, then get a Steam Deck. It's a fantastic entry point into PC gaming and will help you both familiarize yourself with customizing settings (although this is almost completely optional in most cases for supported games) and will help you build up a game library in the event you choose to go all in on PC in the future.",GgJj9Mok9dA,True

This is not okay for me. 

If Console gave players free, no charge option to play online, I'd have a PS5 very soon, as fast as I can buy one. 

PC offers more for me. 
- my choice of controller, any controller I want. No problem
- my choice of how I want my system to look
- my choice to change parts out
- there's no voiding of warranty for upgrading or maintaining my hardware
- large list of games, backwards compatibility. That list goes on and on. 
- ability to control my fan speed, see my hardware temps, control the system to do as I want it to do. Power/voltage usage, overclocking hardware and more. 

- Storage of media (pictures, music, videos, themes, and more)
- the use of local media from onboard storage or connected storage. ( Pictures, music, videos, themes and more )

The list goes on and on. 
I miss when PS3 gave us all this and Sony got greedy and took these options away. Why would I want to put money towards consoles when they took great options away and forced us to pay more money to use an option that was once free for years.

- exclusives like Uncharted 4, Horizon: Zero Dawn, Ratchet & Clank, God of War etc. 

On PC it was mostly about the overclocking part, getting your cheaper CPU or GPU outperform way more expensive parts + using it for everything else except gaming.

@Plus_Escapee,2024-04-02T07:21:05Z,0,"I have a couple points for both console and PC that few people mention; Although the initial cost for PC is expensive for the most premium, cutting edge games, the games themselves are often sold at discount on steam, allowing you to create a virtual collection for less money if you are patient. Not only this, but PC has a massive log of games, many look gorgeous even at a decade old, enhanced further by the power of the hardware. On console, cheating is far less common. If you want a gaming experience that is closer to fair, even ground, you want console, and for competitive games console is far superior for this reason. So, if you like multiplayer PVP and PVE, I recommend console. If you like single player spectacle games or multiplayer PVE, go for PC. I actually advise against playing PVP on PC, although I enjoy it myself, it's frustrating when your favorite game is burdened with cheaters or players who have an unfair imbalance due to hardware differences. Although consoles sometimes offer premium versions, which I believe is a major mistake, it is more or less even ground for multiplayer across the board where this is far from the case on PC.",GgJj9Mok9dA,True
@benbowman6995,2024-04-02T07:20:46Z,0,"So I game on anything and everything and started gaming as a kid in the 90s, from Atari and Commodore 64 to Win95, Nintendo64 into PlayStation 2, 3, and 4 while still gaming on PC through all of that. I have never owned an Xbox but played on my brothers a lot.  I started seriously console gaming around 2008 because I was tired of the struggles at the time to make an older game I liked or just any game, work on PC.  So I bought my first and only PlayStation 3, ""side note I bought it in 2008 and it still works to this day"". I have bought two PlayStation 4s, a regular one and then the Pro version when they came out, both still work to this day and see regular use.  I don't know if you used the PS4 much, but you could also change the HDD on it. Sony actually made it super easy and I switched out both HDDs on my PS4's to SSD 2 TB models and it drastically improved performance.  In 2017 I built my first PC instead of getting pre-built, and I've been hooked on it ever since, I have currently rebuilt my PC completely 3 times since then as I find it a lot of fun to do.

In the future, we may dig into PC building a little more. But for now, a console is a sweet spot that works for us (and we have a few of them).
Oh... and all the older consoles we have also got the tear down treatment (a PS1, a Nintendo WiiU, a gameboy look-a-like made with RPi, Xbox360) Only the switch and XboX series X haven\t been touched by the screwdriver... yet.
Final point: strong emphasis on the PC building/troubleshooting being a heavy influence for a future career path. PC building is 50% responsible for me being an electronics engineer today.",GgJj9Mok9dA,True

@jerm1027,2024-04-02T07:05:20Z,0,"I think the answer really does depend on the how late in the console generation we are in. Consoles are loss-leaders: they sell hardware at a loss (or very close to cost) to recoup costs and profit off of software sales, including the respective network passes. That, alone, is why I will never be a regular console player - it *will* cost more in the long run, full stop. When a console is new, it often is difficult to beat the performance per dollar (not including software cost). Even going second hand, it would be very difficult the achieve performance parity on PC within a budget of a new console, but as the console matures, so too does the PC hardware, so if you aren't afraid to go bargain hunting in the second hand market, you can often find more capable PC hardware about the same has a console buy-in late in the console lifecycle. PC hardware changes more incrementally where as consoles have milestone releases, so the comparative barrier to entry to the PC slides. It's easier late in the console life-cycle, but early in a new console life cycle it's a lot harder to beat the value for the performance. You touched on it with backwards compatibility, but when you start factoring in software costs (i.e. games and network passes), that's where PC starts running away, as the library doesn't reset every generation. Your old games will generally continue to work on PC; if you factor in rebuilding a gaming library into the console price every generation, it gets obscenely expensive.",GgJj9Mok9dA,True

@robmasters3569,2024-04-02T06:54:25Z,0,Hi Jay. You mentioned the guy that started watching your channel and now works for AMD. My story isn't as impressive as that but you are one of the people (along with your channel) that inspired and motivated me to start buying the parts to build my first custom pc with full custom loop. Not only that but I've been a software developer for the last nearly 10 years and have recently embarked on an ICT Level 2 in computer hardware/software/networking and that along with people like yourself inspired me to crack open my old XPS15 that had broken down and completely repair and upgrade a number of components and it now runs as good as new again. I've always been a die hard Mac user but since Windows 8 I fell in love with PCs almost as much as Macs and now I would say I love them both as much and it really comes down to what I need to do at the time as to what platform I jump on to embark on that piece of work or fun or learning. So like I say it's not as impressive as your other story but I wanted to let you and others know that do make a big difference and the ripple affect is far and wide reaching (I'm over in the UK and come from a long history of Mac use so people would probably assume I'm not somebody who would watch channels focused purely on Windows based learning),GgJj9Mok9dA,True

I built my own rig, which is the best I've ever owned - I got the best quality parts available. And it's still a constant pain in the neck. I've burned through two liquid coolers and have now gone to air cooling. I still can't get XMP to work despite updating the BIOS, changing the RAM etc. And it's got some weird intermittent power kernel bug.

@user-ci5gn2ko2n,2024-04-02T06:49:10Z,0,"A few missing things in this video

1) Console makers lose money per sale which is why each console maker has to actually do a lot of first-party work. Gone are the days where a new console release are $40 - $50 and in are the days you will pay  $60 - $100 for a game and then come back later to buy all the DLC, while the PC version that comes out years later has all the DLC (most of the time) for one set price. 

2) Owning a Console means paying Sony or Microsoft for the right to use your internet connection to play games online. Monthly/Yearly fees that do not exist on PC.

3) Peripherals are SUPER and UTTERLY expensive, and they DO break. How about a third-party controller that is double the price of a PC controller but half the price of a first-party console controller? Not so fast... it may be an ""illegal controller"" in which a first party will send a signal to your console to shut down that controller and make it not work, forcing you to buy a 1st party controller at MSRP, or else. 

4) Power Consumption is misleading. PCs run using 80% - 90% efficient PSUs. Console efficiency is a lot lower. In fact, I have an APU PC and a monitor connected to solar power that consumes 60w of power when playing older games. 

5) I remember what happened with Playstation 3 where it came out, and then patch after patch they kept on removing features and the people who hacked the console to recover those features again were arrested and tried for it. An appellate court had to overturn the case due to what truly went on in there. It pushed a lot of people who knew to think twice about a console. 

6) During Black Friday, I bought a monitor for $129 from Microcenter that was 240hz refresh rate and 1080P gaming. Your typical console owner will buy the console, and then buy a TV with high refresh rate for around $500 - $1000. After being happy with their console, they will want to play every console exclusive to follow that school of fish that travels through the hype-stream out of FOMO every new release, so to travel together they will buy every console that is out there, pay for every online service to play online and before you know it, cost a ton of money. My neighbor knows this well. 

What started as an innocent purchasing of a Xbox Series S for cheap for her kid became a crusade of buying the latest Xbox, playstation, switch, etc along with remodeling the room, paying for all monthly subscriptions to play online, and buying furniture, peripherals, better TVs resulting in spending around $4000 in a single year on all of that including the games and the higher cost of electric bills.",GgJj9Mok9dA,True

I mean there'll always be gaming boxes to hook up to a TV in the living room, technically they'll just be PCs and no longer a console with a closed OS.
Look at the situation right now, take Sony, they spend gazillions in R&D and partners with AMD for years to develop a console, sell their HW at a loss for at least 2 years but get the money back with games sold at high prices, accessories, PSN,...
Then they realise if they want to abide by the rule their profit HAS to improve every year, porting games to PC is the magical solution, when AAAs cost hundreds of millions of dollars and 5+ years to make, why limit yourself to one machine? Porting to PC is just a way to have a better ROI on the money spent making the games.
For now, gaming PCs are still too expensive to entirely replace consoles but with the technological progress, it's only a matter of years before the efficiency of APUs, Upscalers and Frame Generation techs will make 600$ gaming PCs a reality. Companies like nVidia will keep pumping out new techs for people to keep buying their overpriced HW but it's really not necessary to enjoy games, right?

I do wish you mentioned the Switch/Steam Deck vs Laptops, as they also are part of this topic and have very strong points.
I also just want to mention that while I do agree with all your points, this is the US demographic you're speaking about/to.
The reason why consoles still exist is that many in the world are not fortunate to have enough disposable income and high-speed internet, the main draw of PC games.
A significant portion of Sony's profits lies in PS4/5 sales and commission through the PSN.
The other thing we forget as PC enthusiasts is that to the lay person, all of the PC specs are mumbo-jumbo.
They also just sometimes are blissfully ignorant, not being able to tell that they been playing at 60hz the entire time on their 144hz because they didn't change settings.
Other people want a warranty for an expensive purchase. Consoles have decent warranty/repairs/returns.

It is likely your dead 360s would have lasted longer if you regularly cleaned it and changed thermal paste. They tend to run hot so you want to give them the best chance at longevity. I don't use my consoles much but I need to do some maintenance from time to time. I know this is unrealistic for most console users. In fact a lot of PC owners don't properly maintain their PC. 
Generally, because they are cost optimized, consoles are just never going to be any better than a midrange gaming PC in terms of performance. The reason they offer value for money is because they are the loss leader. You give away the lamp and then make money selling overpriced lightbulbs. Consoles are  typically sold at cost or even at a loss to move the games. 
It may be more expensive to build a midrange gaming PC than to buy an XBox One X but it is offset by deeper discounts on older games and the fact that Epic gives away a lot of free games. Amazon too if you have Prime. With the value of all those free games taken into account, the PC is arguably the more cost effective gaming platform. Some of the best games I ever played I got for free. Currently enjoying the crap out of Guardians of the Galaxy, which I got free on Epic. Fallout games, Borderlands games, the Bioshock Collection, the Tomb Raider collection and lots of other awesome AAA games. These are all games I probably would have paid money for. Then there are some awesome indie titles too. I have gotten tons of classic games from Amazon from the '90s and '00s. SCUMM games, tons of SNK arcade games, BG 1 and 2 Enhanced editions, numerous Star Wars games and some solid more recent titles.

Also for a console if you like playing online you have to pay a monthly fee, not so for most games on pc, back in the day there was a point to having a console or both consoles, now more and more there's just no point, just count the cost, buy a playstation and xbox, pay for online for both, pay a higher price on average for games, that's not cheap either, also take into account again that atleast with the xbox if the ssd dies the xbox itself is a worthless paperweight, requiring a complete new xbox.

I got a similar argument from people that wanted me to get a laptop instead of a desktop pc, I don't really see the point of a laptop for home use unless you have no space or something, a gaming laptop is very expensive, weaker vs a pc with similar hardware, the battery drains incredibly fast, no, if you have the space and don't take it with you a desktop is always better, I only use laptops for work where I need something portable.",GgJj9Mok9dA,True

• Investment, used for work or play but also  can be designed one way and completly changed around for a different look to match a room or ashtestic however you want.

With what you said about the resolution and 4k30, you can change the resolution in settings. Or play on a monitor or TV that isnt 4k.

The games just look and run better and the customizable experience from the hardware all the way down to the software is something I'm always gonna be in favor of.

I will say that there are definitely people passionate about consoles but I think it really comes down to what games were exclusive for that console.  The playstation was my first console growing up and I have very fond memories of FFVII, multiple Tekkens, Crash Bandicoot, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater (I know some of those games were on other platforms but I digress).  Consoles really make it all about the games.  And if the games aren't there, there's not a lot to say about them hardware wise.  Some older consoles have some interesting stories behind them but that's a different kind of passion.  More so history than the science behind engineering.

Although I had fun building it, I never got the kick to go build another one, but I do want to build one for my girlfriend. I have a friend who's thinking about getting a PC, and I offered to build it for him to save him some cost on the PC. But to me it's more of a side thing because I'm a cheapskate and like saving money 😂😂

One thing I have noticed though, is I'm a hard-core gamer. So when I switched to PC and forced myself to learn mouse and keyboard. I have the hang of it and now perform similar to my levels on console, I actually find I enjoy the increased frames, the higher fidelity, the lower response time. I play my PS5 right now because of circumstances, but for a while I was almost always on my PC, and any cross platform games that were available I rather play them on my PC. Overall my experience was just better.

Granted, I dropped about $2600 to buy everything and get almost the best of the best for everything a PC has to offer. So the buy in was really expensive. But I use my PC for modeling as I'm trying to make a game. My PC handles it like a breeze. Any games I play on high settings sit around 200 FPS minimum and max at 240 since my monitor stops there. I only lag when my internet sucks. 


Overall I'd say a PC is definitely worth the money. If you cant drop that amount of money all at once then do what i did and buy pieces over time. But if you don't have the money to spare and you don't want to buy it piece by piece, then a console really isn't a bad experience.

@flumphflumph6021,2024-04-02T05:32:09Z,0,"I've recently went for a custom PC because I felt that I could not trust the PS5.
I don't like that the PS5 has a bespoke SSD chip attached to it's Motherboard in a similar way to how cheap laptops have Micro SD Cards soldered in to cut out of having an actual HDD or SSD. Yes, having the unique SSD chip means that it's harder to tamper with (didn't stop people from hacking the system anyways) but as it can't be replaced or cloned, it limits the systems overall lifespan and stops users from really giving it a boost of memory. I believe it was designed to become landfill.
Add in that it runs hot enough to melt it's own thermal paste into dripping across the motherboard and frying it if the system is stood upright and has rather patchy performance for some of the more recent titles and I don't want it. Also, some of the PS5 + PS4 multireleases run better on PS4 so feel free to take that as you will.

As to what I wanted to play on the PS5? Ratchet and Clank and Dragon's Dogma 2 which have thankfully got PC ports on steam. Other than those two games, I haven't seen anything on the PS5 that I'd want to play or I simply don't know about them as Sony will only ever advertise Fifa to me (yay for peace of mind). I also believe the PS5 while it has succeeded financially has failed technologically for developers as it is just shy of achieving the performance they wanted for grander open-world titles so they may be holding back a number of titles already for the PS6 . . . plus because everything has to be photorealistic for the PS5, the Dev times are insane at 5 to 9 years and if Forspoken is anything to go by as a ""well designed experience with fun gameplay"" (the story is naff) then I'd rather go with a more expensive system with many options than Sony's slow meandering Flagship.
Note: The Xbox X just lacks interesting exclusives and most of it's digital Library can also be found on Steam, Ps4 or Switch.

@DannysCustoms,2024-04-02T05:22:24Z,0,I'm sitting on that fence ATM. I'm using my PC less because of time and the less I do the more updates needed so its not like a console that I can just turn on and play. I feel like consoles and PCs need a crossover point especially as physical media is getting harder to own and companies want to move to pay to play. Something like a itx size build that you can use as a power efficient home server for media and steam storage that can run torrents in the background and keep everything updated but with a front end like google TV you can control with a remote. Watch Netflix etc but when you want to game hit the icon and turn on your controller and pick what you want to play. Something more powerful than a console but closer in size to a Corsair 2000D.

1) There are a lot more games that are available on the Windows/PC platform than either Xbox or PS5.

(Project Playtime, Cities Skylines 2 (though it is supposed to be coming out on consoles, but it won't happen for a while), Overcrowd, Production Line, etc.)

2) When the system isn't being used for gaming, the hardware itself can be repurposed for other tasks as well, which is vastly more difficult to do with a console.

3) The lifecycle of one PC can span multiple lifecycles of consoles.

I still have a PS3 because I'm too cheap to upgrade the console. (And even then, that was a Christmas present that I got from a family member because I wouldn't buy it myself.)

I get about 7 to 8 years out of my computer before making upgrades. So you'll pay $840 over 7 years for a subscription. Then the cost of the console making that close to $1300. And then the cost of games... I really hate to say, but steam sales cuts the cost of games pretty hardcore. I also don't need an older system to play older title games.

I personally had my ""last"" PC from ~2014 till 2019, when I upgraded i5-3470 to e3-1230v2 for ~$25 which was a massive upgrade (games like division 2 ran smoothly after it, and I could watch youtube 720p and play games at the same time), and in ~2018 I switched my old HD5850 to 1050Ti for ~$100. In 2023 I upgraded my PSU and GPU for ~$300 to 6600xt and it was a massive jump, I finished Cyberpunk 2077 in mid/high 1440p stable 45fps without upscaling.
So ye upgradability over time and how long base platform can last me is a big thing for me. Same goes for Emulation, and ofc Piracy (not that I do much of it, last thing I ""pirated"" was Phantom Liberty, checked what files were new when it hit and just copied folder from a friend who had GoG version), oh and modding, as you can breath some fresh air into many games with them.",GgJj9Mok9dA,True

@Lero_Po,2024-04-02T04:29:34Z,0,"I switched from console to PC permanently about half a year ago or so. Yes, consoles do offer better performance than similarly priced PCs, but if you want to play any multiplayer games that aren't F2P, you have to pay a subscription in order to play them on top of the initial cost of the game. $60 a year on Xbox, $80 a year on PS minimum. 

On top of that, Xbox and PS have their own servers for their services, and like all servers, they can and will run into problems. At best these problems can make a single game unplayable for a few hours, and at worst they can prevent people from logging into their accounts for several days, making their consoles largely if not completely unusable.

I don't like subscriptions, and I despise the possibility of my setup being unusable due to something completely out of my control, which is why I'll never look back.",GgJj9Mok9dA,True

@ace052330,2024-04-02T04:24:07Z,0,"Before even watching go ahead and tell ya, HELL NO. I own a PS5 and Switch. Enjoy them both a lot, however only reason for owning them is exclusive games I enjoy otherwise would have no need. When you purchase a console you need to account for the yearly sub in the cost as well as the price of games. When you buy a PC sure its more expensive or can be, but there is no monthly sub just to play online, games are cheaper with way more and better sales, Epic Games Store gives you 3-4 free literally free games a month. No sub of any kind required. Plus its a whole ass computer so it can do all kinds of shit other than gaming. On top of being able to use any monitor/tv you want, with your choice of peripherals/any controller you like, at any resolution you like. On top of having a higher, often much much higher frame rate, much better graphics/visuals, the ability to customize your games settings in-depth, the ability to mod games which can drastically change the experience, and the OPTION to upgrade 2-3 years down the road for a performance boost if you so choose. it's just no contest regardless of how you go about it.  I think the Switch is a great machine for what it is. Love some of the games on that platform. The hardware is so dated tho, it was weak when it launched and now it just holds it back more often than now. Just imagine Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom or Xenoblade 3 on PC. PS5 also a great machine. Compared to my PS4 Pro was a giant leap forward. The load times are insane often faster than my PC's Gen5 NVMe drive with a Ryzen 7800X3D/RTX 4070 Ti Super. The game for the most part do look good and generally hit 60 fps or close to it at least on the performance option which isn't 4k and usually requires some type of upscaling or dynamic resolution with even further reduced graphics. Still it's drastically better than prior gen consoles which were almost always 30. However when giving the option to play the same game on PC it's just clearly superior. As I said better visuals, DLSS combined with Raytracing is amazing on 280hz 1k HDR certified 4k monitor and even tho 60 fps is much much better than 30 once you get use to gaming often between 150-200+ fps depending on the game whilst having better visuals at the same time its just impossible to go back. I've literally never met anyone who switched from console to PC and said they wanted to go back. Everyone only wishes they had done it sooner. That's not to even touch on the fact that you can make the PC exactly how you want it. Both in terms of hardware and looks. You can customize it inside and out. Tinkering is hella fun, overclocking to get more performance, there is just so much more that a PC offers over a console that yea the initial price is gonna be more but over time you will recoup most of that back in cheaper/free games and no monthly sub on top of it being exactly what you want. A console may be cheaper initially but over time that cost keeps building and building, esp if you're someone who always buys the Pro revisions mid life cycle and you can't customize it in any way, every single one is the exact same, it's just a no brainer to me personally.

@STAG162,2024-04-02T03:42:10Z,0,"no one will read this, but I've owned all of them (PC/Xbox/PSx) over the last 25 years. ofc I started with PC (386DX33) years earlier and still use them today. had PS2/3/4 over many years. will never go there again. reason: Sony. my first PC had a single-spin Sony CD-ROM and the drivers cost extra as they weren't included with the DOS disks. their reasoning: ""proprietary"" and they've bloody-mindedly been riding the same scooter all this time in one way or another. on the PS4 they didn't bring anything new to the table like they did in previous iterations, just upgraded some hardware, but their drawcard in the PS2/3 was their ability to get among the new hardware for reading media, ie. CD/DVD/Bluray. PS4: they had all the chances in the world to bump up the tech in the readable media to a 4K UHD solution, but nooo.. they wanted people to own stuff ""digitally"" not on solid-state media anymore, and thus didn't budge from a Bluray-capable drive. I watch movies on 4K UHD when I can on a big screen, and Sony releasing the PS5 with such a feature is too little, FAAAARR too late, esp. when the previous Xbox version(s) had 4K UHD drives. I have reasons for not wanting to own anything digitally, and some of it comes down to where I live and the internet not being up to speed like the rest of the modernised world, but also would prefer my ownership be on a physical state medium rather than ones and zeroes. I love gaming and always have, so I still game on PC and now with the Xbox Series X (owned for 2 years without fault so far) I can play Forza Horizon 5 or watch my 4K UHD discs on a big screen, while giving Sony the middle finger. interesting note: consoles still have the slot for physical media, ie. Bluray discs, etc. but PCs have moved away from this. sorry for the rant but this is a horse Sony gave me to ride, and I don't care if its bones are turning to dust, I'm still riding it.",GgJj9Mok9dA,True

PC

- piracy (free games) 😅
- mods
- massive game sales on steam
- if you decided to upgrade to 1440p or even 4k not only youll have to get a new monitor, youll also have to get a much more expensive gpu

PS5
- new games will perform better on day 1 (games on pc arent optimized well these days)
- with the amount of money to buy a pc, you could buy a ps5 and a 4k tv
- digital renting of games for cheap
- some games are blurry in 60fps performance mode. 30fps quality mode solves that but 30fps of course sucks

PC gaming on a budget means you are still spending more than a console but you get barely any of the benefits of the pc. And you need to upgrade more frequently. Which means spending more money sooner on hardware. Or you can just buy a console and be set. Now if you have the wallet for a actual gaming pc then get the pc as well as a console. Consoles ps5 and switch are going to have games pc doesnt. And you wont get them for quite sometime. Stop being a fanboy of any platform. Have a preferred platform but get out of the platform fanboying, all it does it hurt you at the end of the day.

I own pc, ps5 and switch. Will get the switch2 or what ever the fuck nintendo calls their next system.And i will get a ps6 when that launches as well as a 5000 series gpu to upgrade from my 3080.

@davidsmusicbox5866,2024-04-02T02:55:14Z,0,"For me the big things I have with pc over console are A) upgradability. Most of the parts I get I somewhat ‘future proof’ (as best you actually can). Every few years (3-5 usually) I will get one or two parts that are the big bottleneck, at the cost of usually less than a console. And that 3-5 years tends to be inline with a new generation of consoles. So in the end, ends up being about the same after that upfront cost. 2) Steam, and mods. Steam makes saving money on games much easier with their sales, and a much wider breadth of games. Then add in mods giving games much more replayability, it makes the dollars spent on games stench MUCH further. iii) the tinkering aspect. I just find the tinkering so much fun. Sure theres ‘more’ upkeep with dusting it out a lot more and such. But I find that fun. I enjoy being able to tear into it to do all that.

@colooutdoors8949,2024-04-02T02:54:39Z,0,"Here are my top 5 reasons for going to PC

I’ve had consoles my whole life and never touched a PC for gaming besides some gaming back in the mid 90’s.
1. I hate the feeling of being a few years out of another sale. The mid life refresh making me want the “slightly improved version” then to wait a few more years and then a whole new console. I’ve seen 4 PlayStations 5s since they launched.. So if I bought the PS5 at launch. Non scalper price of $550 then the mid generation refresh of another $550, I’m $1100 in. Idk man it just sucks to be strapped to just that hardware. 
2. Competitive FPS games ( switched off the PS4 Pro before PS5 launch) I couldn’t hang. Warzone KD .68 (ya I’m old so back off) to 2.1 on mouse and key
2. Tired of having to pay a service to play online games
3. It was a bummer not having a variety of games at my disposal. 
4. The graphical difference between what I have now vs what I can be offered on console. 
5. You nailed it. Building a PC created a hobby that is near an addiction. Call me sick but I’ve taken my computer apart multiple times just to rearrange fans, cables, mess with other configurations of MB, RAM, RGB, coolers etc. it’s just like building cars, you make it yours and it’s a sense of pride that’s established.

@m.a.l.s5793,2024-04-02T02:47:34Z,0,"I have to disagree with the sentiment that consoles fail more than PCs. I've had a PS1,PS2, ps2 slim, PS3, PS3 slim, ps3 super slim, PS4, PS4 Pro, and now the launch day PS5 and the only one I have had fail on me is the launch day PS3. And that was after 3 years of having the launch day 60GB model. The replacement Sony sent me I still have and use, as does my 4 pro and the 5 gets used daily. 
And that is with zero maintenance. I've never taken apart any of my consoles to clean them or replace the TIM. PCs on the other hand get that every 10 months at least. 

PC on the other hand.... Let's just say if I had a nickel for every PC issue, I have experienced over the last 10 years I would be the richest man alive! And that's just desktops, laptops I haven't had a single one last more than 3 months without going back for repairs! Hell, even my current AM5 system I have now occasionally decides nope you've neglected us for too long were not posting now and I have to go in and reset the CMOS than it works fine for a few months till the next time it decides it's feeling neglected again. 

Not to mention how poor PC ports have become lately. Not to mention Windows HDR is still as ^%$^ed up as it was at launch with windows 10. Currently playing Avatar and my god that game looks amazing but come on can we PLEASE fix the raised black issues in literally EVERY PC release!  HDR has been a joke on Windows since 10 came out, and it has improved literally 0% in all these years. 

Whether you should buy a PC, or a console, is easy. Ask yourself do you want to spend more time fixing things than playing your game? Yes? Then buy a PC. No? Then buy a console. Simple as that! Not to mention when you ring Microsoft or Sony they will actually help you, unlike Gigabyte, AsRock, or ASUS. MSI on the other hand good luck getting anyone to answer the phone. Last time I rang them was for a faulty GS73 notebook and the tech support line automatically diverted to a voicemail that spoke extremely broken English! 4 voicemails and 7 years later I eagerly await their return phone call.

@bradb3527,2024-04-02T02:46:51Z,0,"I feel attacked!! LOL
I got into PC gaming in beginning of 2022. It's attached to my 55"" 4K TV that is 120hz 😂. Now, I understand the difference of monitor vs TV and the argument of it, but for me, this works and fits my usage.
I play for fidelity, not fps performance. I achieve 4K over 60 fps on my titles I play, which my gaming isn't competitive fps or high paced games.
Add in that I would then need to spend to buy a desk, chair, speakers to go along with my gaming headset for time and place. And now that I'm already on 4k@120hz, I would need to spend the cost of my 55 inches for something a 1/4 the size for the same cost for same specs.
(Try to tell me a RTX3070 OC can't do 4K lol)

I'm happily sitting on my couch gaming my laid back games in high resolution and good, stable, frame rate.

@RandarTheBarbarian,2024-04-02T02:27:28Z,0,"I can see why someone would come to the conclusion that they're just gonna go with a console. We haven't really had a great example of a $500 console killer in a hot minute, there are some good used parts builds out there that I would rather have than a console for under $500 but they're not without tradeoffs. 

The tradeoff I'm never going to accept though is the console walled garden, the things could be $100 and it wouldn't matter because I think greater access to indie titles is just so valuable, I don't know the last time I even enjoyed a AAA game enough to play it through. Then there's the access to old titles in my steam library that as far as consoles are concerned are lost to time, I can go back and play even native games from the early 2000s, not to mention emulation of machines that are rapidly dying or dead. When I finally hit the point where microsoft has pushed me too far (looking at the impending EOL of win10) I've got the open source option to fall back on, I don't wanna have to do a workaround to install the OS on my system and then another to have a local account, thanks MS.

Say what you want about the pricing of building a PC in the current market, and you'd probably be right, new parts prices suck, and while I would argue there's plenty of CPU generations that are still fine (I still wouldn't scoff at a decent 8th gen chip and that's going on 7 years old) even used prices on GPUs newer than 10 series I think are a lot higher than they should be, but there's something about my PC that I couldn't say about a console, I own it. I put this machine together, I'm free to modify it as I please, I can run what software I please new and old, AAA to solo dev, I don't pay a ransom to the console manufacturer to play online with who I please, and that's just not something I can say with a console. Plus if I had a family, or when I want to play games with friends, the couch gaming side on PC I think is a lot better, sure some of the better ones filter through into xbox or playstation, but it goes back to that near infinite backlog of games that are too old or never made it to console in the first place.

And uhh, in a year where the biggest smart TV manufacturer disabled TVs if you didn't agree to arbitration, where sony themselves removed content that people paid for, and corporate consolidation leads to more property being in greedier hands, having the option to wear the old tricorn hat and go out captaining isn't something that should be discounted either.

I left PS and Xbox when the PS5 and Xbox one X or whatever the latest Xbox was doing its $600 price tag, decided to just go back to PC and build a sweet system. I tinker with my PC regularly. I dropped the Xbox One once my wifi Card died. My PC (after 3 years) had my C drive and PSU die almost in the same week. Took me a little time to trouble shoot. But I can do so much more with my PC than my Xbox or PS could. Plan to stay with the PC for another 7ish years and will then re-evaluate at that time.
1) like building my own things
2) if built correctly, you have a solid system for 7 - 10 years with minor tweeks and cleaning
3) It matches my style, my system catches the eyes of anybody that has to go through my house. I get comments about it and questions everyday.
4) Exclusives have for the most part gone away, I can play anything I want, worst case is I have to wait a year. Most of my friends have moved to PC as well and we just all prefer it for communication.
5) I like the control mods and options for other input devices for PC over PS or Xbox, most of what I end up buying is compatible with Xbox as well as a weird bonus.",GgJj9Mok9dA,True

Xbox has basically sabotaged themselves. They release exclusive games day and date with the PC. Pay for GamePass Ultimate and even a low spec potato can stream games as long as the internet is good. There's really no reason to buy an Xbox console.

Sony aren't perfect either, now bringing many of their exclusives to PC. At the same time though they at least give a decent amount of time between the console and PC release, there's still a reason to get a PS5 if you want to play their games straight away.

Nintendo's current system is so underpowered that near five year old phone SoCs can play many of its titles via emulation and all the overhead that method brings.

It genuinely doesn't mean the PC platform itself is any better than console just that the sole methodology of how we compute things is with this type of hardware. There is a difference between hardware and platform and therefore saying the PC platform itself is better than anything else because of hardware is a bit of a joke. If you're talking pure performance of the hardware, as in components, then it has a cost behind it be it higher power or higher upfront cost which does matter to a lot of people.

The PS5 and Xbox Series X use AMD GPUs. The only current console to not have an AMD GPU is the Nintendo Switch which has NVIDIA. 

Consoles are just fine and don't need to go anywhere. Well maybe Xbox is on its last legs but PlayStation and Nintendo are doing just fine and don't need to go anywhere.

Xbox, haven't had one for a while but I wouldn't be surprised if it was a similar situation. 

Meanwhile on PC you can still use a freakin' Xbox 360 controller if you wanted, hook a PS3 controller up- PC has better compatibility with the competition's gear than the competition does with their, own, products. Also, on PC you have the ability to use tons of 3rd party controllers - and there's actually GREAT 3rd party controllers these days like 8bitdo. 

I have gear that's several gens old on my rig, no need to upgrade it because it still bloody works.

@firstlast-cs6eg,2024-04-02T01:52:23Z,0,"One benefit of PC over console is cheaper and free games, and some games you can't get on console even. There are so many games you can get for dirt cheap or free on PC that cost alot more on console or aren't even available on console. This effect of PC games being much cheaper becomes bigger as games get older. Sure Console games will drop in price as well, but nothing like PC games will for the most part. *Essentially there are PC exclusive games.* Not forbidden from console, just never finding their way onto console. 

Consoles might take a bit of a loss even on the hardware counting on making it up with extra expensive games.

Another benefit is moding tends to be bigger and more accessible on PC verses console.

             Another difference is that console games are designed for controllers where as most PC games are designed around keyboard and mouse. IMO keyboard and mouse is generally better, but it depends on the game and how well it was done. Some ported games switch to keyboard and mouse but don't do so well. Of course there are PC games that use and are designed for controller use. The flip side is rare, most console games can't really be played with keyboard and mouse.",GgJj9Mok9dA,True

I build my PC's always as gaming PC. Reason is, u can work perfecly on a Gaming PC, but the other way around... And there comes the big con. Price. Special the GPU's today. But it really just hits, when there are gen changes. Or socet changes. So, with a good start Investment and some tweaks over the years u can go pretty far with a pc. Till u hit a gen change it's not that expensive over lets say 5-7 years. At least it was like that in the past. Let's see where the prices rocket.

 Price vs performance is the ONLY place the console belongs in the conversation. BUT the cheaper up front cost screws you in the long run. No ability to do minor (or major) hardware upgrades. And the likely prospect of losing most (if not all) of your games between generations.  Sure, simpler games on console can support higher framerates but more and more you see open world games locked at 30fps.  And often times, you aren't give a choice.  100% of the time i would rather turn down a few settings to play a game at over 120fps then be stuck with graphics settings maxed out while getting 30fps.

PC was master race for me. Last year i built a realllly beefy machine and a good 2k monitor with a 4080 and 7950x and went through the trouble of learning how to oc, undervolt, apply curve offsets to both gpus and cpus and i cant look back now.  I have a very optimized and tuned setup that allows me to do literally everything. I can 3d edit, train AI if i wanted, run any high end engineering software, stream, i can run raytracing and path tracing on my system with good visuals and refresh rate thanks to the new upscaling tech trickled down from the AI boom. 
I remember laughing at cyberpunk when it was announced and years after cause no one could play it and it was buggy as all hell. after i finished my system, that was the first game i got (also the anime ((Which is really good btw)) + the remastered tech trees came out which helped the hype and made the gameplay more immersive) and i cranked it to psycho settings with all the eye candy, rt, pt (when it released) on with dlss on quality... pretty much always stays between 72-90 fps, perfectly acceptable for single player gaming and felt buttery smooth. i was playing games i couldnt touch yet on my old prebuilt (nor anyone else for that matter) on settings most people have never seen turned on and this was as a first time experience.  Not saying all this to gloat, im saying all this cause it felt AWESOME! no console will deliver what i got to experience. I got to try out enthusiast gaming and was extremely happy about it. 
The one downside is my rig was made up of mostly inheritance money, and the total cost for just the pc was $3200... which no console will ever touch either XD  (thats a good thing though)
plus side is, from now on i only have to upgrade 1 bit at a time, and i wont need to for many years from now. ive been thinking of lapping my cpu for my first ""upgrade"" and running it till its completely obsolete . Im getting 39200 multi and 2050 single scores in Cbr23.

A few Example of Games with MODS that Fix Bugs, Improve, can offer up to hundreds of hours of more content and/or can even give Players a brand new experience: 

- GTA5: RP Servers and others. 

- Minecraft: Literally the main reason as why it’s still relevant is because of MODS. For instance the best RuneScape MOD that’s ever been created for Minecraft called “RSMC: The Third Age”. There has been at least 20+ attempts since that have attempted to implement RuneScape into Minecraft, but while some had more than others none truly succeeded until RSMC which is understandable because that’s an inane task. 

I played so much vanilla Minecraft on 360 and Xbox One before strictly going to PC that I’ll never play vanilla again. In particular if I do play it’ll be RSMC because my god who knew how well RuneScape and Minecraft together would be so good. 

- Elders Scroll: The undisputed #1 Champions for Game with the best Mods and potential because the Devs give the community the same Dev Tool they use.  

I will say it was a huge W that you can download Skyrim Mods Console. Xbox gets more access to MODS than PlayStation, but nothing like PC.

@omargonzalez7501,2024-04-02T01:09:57Z,0,"I might be in the minority here, but the only reason I still play my PS5, is because of the Trophies. Specifically going for the Platinum Trophies. I got my very first trophy on the PS3 back in July 2010 when I started playing Modern Warfare 2. My first Platinum Trophy was Modern Warfare 2, my rarest Platinum Trophy is Red Dead Redemption 2, and my latest Platinum Trophy was Helldivers 2. I actually got it 3 days ago. In the 14 years that I’ve had my Playstation account, I’ve managed to get 41 Platinum Trophies and I have accumulated over 3500 trophies. This is not a great or crazy achievement by any means. There are people out there who have way more than me. I don’t try to get the Platinum for every game that I play. But sometimes I just get the itch to try and fully complete a game at 100%. I get a quick dopamine feeling when I know I’m about to finish the grind for that last trophy. And I feel a sense of satisfaction when I see that Platinum Trophy pop up. But at the same time, I’m also a PC player. In fact I have 2 PC’s. I’ve even rebought console titles on my PC just to replay them again and see how vastly different it can perform on. I know that Steam has Achievements as well. But I’ve never had the feeling to try and complete all the achievements for a game on PC. I guess maybe because I have had such a long history on console and grinding for the Trophies that I don’t want to give that up or just leave that all behind. I am really proud of the achievements that I have completed, but I just won’t ever leave console behind. I don’t want all my achievements to just be left behind and forgotten. I enjoy PC gaming the same as I enjoy console gaming. Had it not been for the Trophy Grind that I started years ago, I probably would’ve fully committed to PC gaming entirely. Like I said in the beginning, I know there is a minor group of us out there who are Trophy Hunters. Some will understand where I’m coming from, some might not. In the end we are all gamers and it doesn’t matter which platform we play on. The point is to just quit the arguing of which is better and just enjoy gaming.",GgJj9Mok9dA,True

It had slowly be struggling to play two of the games I tend to play the most. Swapping to PC has been a game changer. The clarity in the graphics is amazing and that's with me still on a 1080p TV. Getting a monitor will be the next step, but for now I couldn't be happier. Just as an example, for a long time now, when loading into a Resurgence game on CoD, my graphics would have Minecraft quality for the first few minutes. And there was more than once where my reticule would not even load up. I have gig fiber internet, so that wasn't the problem. I would also either not load in with my team or load in late. 

I don't have that issue now. I load in with everyone else and the quality is what'd you expect. I overbuilt my PC and I know that. But I wanted something that would keep for quite a few years. Could I have saved money and gotten the same results upgrading to a new Xbox X console? More than likely. I don't think I'd change a thing though.

Most of the games that come on discs have day-one patches or don't even have the full game inside, requiring the user to download everything (once again, always online crap).

Consoles don't have exclusives anymore, there is no single franchise exclusive to consoles except for Nintendo. The rest are only day-one exclusives and then they release them on PC.

PCs are priced higher?, it's true, but you get a full-fledged computer, without DRM restrictions or disk encryting crap (if your drive goes bad, you are screwed as you are not able to perform any sort of data recovery because of encryption). Consoles have nowhere near the same degree of freedom that you'd get with a PC. Also, you can install any piece of software and do so much more on PC.

@dampintellect,2024-04-02T00:42:07Z,0,"I'm in a niche position when it comes to this topic. I know a lot of people like the fact that a single PC can game and do everything else. But with how intrusive games are becoming with their anti-cheats you may not want to put your work and games on the same PC anymore. Personally I probably wouldn't consider a console for this. They have their own issues in the area of privacy, but at least they separate your games from everything else, assuming you don't do work on the console. Depending on what you do for work this may adjust, but a simple PC for work and then a full power PC for gaming would be optimal. However, there is a missed option here, and that is handhelds. Something like a steam deck specifically for gaming could be the answer here. The Steam deck plus a PC capable enough for your work load is decent scenario. This way you keep your important data separated from the games. It also depends on how important your data is, but if it is even somewhat serious, I would seriously consider separating the machines for security purposes. Although if you work for a company they may already provide you with hardware for this reason. I mean just look at the linux situation where a back door was added to xz affecting debian and other distros that merge systemd controls with xz and ssh, there are a lot of eyes on linux so it was caught quickly, but what is to stop rouge dev either from inside or outside of the company from highjacking their rootkit anticheats and accessing your files.

@douglasreid699,2024-04-02T00:28:26Z,0,"it all comes down to what you want to do with the PC or Console, if its just to game (with the games available to that console), the console will be the better option as its plug in and play and cheaper and as a bonus you get some extra things. if you need to do other things more often and game, PC is better. 
i played consoles up to 2018, had an xbox one at the time then i started watching xpgamers play space engineers and i bought myself a pc that could play it, cost me £1000 for a HP pavilion tower, had a tv with hdmi and it come with mouse and keyboard. i played my xbox one until i got so fed up with xbox updates (had a rather basic internet broadband connection), to the point i turned on my ps2 and played star wars battlefront 2 or GTA san Andrea's while i waited for it to update, then turned off the xbox as the ps2 was better and thats where i decided to buy the PC and have not looked back since. over the years i have done a few upgrades, i found games on sale through steam that keep me happy, probably overall saved money getting the next generation of consoles buy the time you add subscriptions and buying games at retail price in. and when i get round to buying and possibly building my own pc next, my current pc can get turned into a movie PC or a NAS for storage or something else, it can still be used for something where as an old console cant really, all you can do is play that era of games on it, if it breaks, hope you can get a decent second hand one to keep it going.

PC is still the better option, but as years go buy it will still be more expensive to get into. thats where you need to think of it as an investment, how many years will you get out of a console at $500 price, probably 5, thats $100 per year. i am currently on year 6, this pc could/should last past year 10, in $ its the same investment of $100 a year (if i dont convert £ to $, say it was $1000 to buy), thats what you need to take into account when thinking of buying a PC or console, what are you going to get back from your investment. the price difference between PC and console has probably not changed much, its just as inflation has gone up over the years, things seem more expensive than they were years ago.",GgJj9Mok9dA,True

where on PC you can get free games from time to time, discounts at steam,epic and Gog  and you are not married to an ecosystem. like i said you can buy from different stores and cdkeys for cheaper games. 

also you can emulate older platforms on PC while on console YOU CANT DO THAT. 

on pc you can use either windows or linux or even emulate android if you like. with consoles you CANT DO THAT

its true that pc is expensive but it can return your investment over time, good luck doing that with sony, xbox or nintendo

I would say that the majority of all internal playtests done in a gaming company is done on PC. Yes you have QA to test every little detail on the consoles as well, but by sheer amount of game tests the PC versions should have less bugs in them. Not saying that's always the case, but it seems the numbers should point that way. Would be interesting to see the numbers on amount of bugs, console vs pc.

But although I mostly use PC's I do have consoles too and I a PC for me is better due to what I do.

It is a shame that the consoles don't come customized like able to choose a faster or slower CPU Module, Graphics Module, Storage etc and so on.
Like say you have the console for like 5 years and a new game comes out on console that requires a better more faster Processor or GPU that supports new features etc, then you would only need to upgrade that module.
Sadly they won't do that due to they want you to buy the next gen console, just like Microsoft wants you to buy the newer OS and also make you buy new PC hardware due to Windows requirements which is what they say and is not what is really needed.

1. You can't play every Xbox title on Windows. Lots of older titles are still only on console, including a lot on Game Pass, so they still are very accessible and worth considering.
2. Xbox games are optimized for console. Consoles are and always have been more reliable on the whole. If you don't have the time or mentality to mess with resolving issues on PC (esp. a PC at any similar price point, and if those issues are even resolvable), Xbox is still a very viable choice. Depends almost exclusively on the budget, and even more so on the use case (time, expertise, specific games you want to play, etc).

The problem with consoles is they got rid of renting games.  So now you have to drop $$$ each title and current times, 99% of the titles AAA or otherwise is absolute trash.  Consoles are cheap up front but then they nickel and dime you to death.   
PC's...  PC gamers such as Jay or myself... we are doing it because of other reasons beyond the games.  Avoid as much crap that has branded ""game"", ""gamer"" and ""extreme.""  It's all just over priced junk.  Both modern AMD and Intel APU's play games good.  I mean really good compared to back when.  They seem to do even better running Linux then Windows in my experience so I'd actually recommend ditching Windows.  My daughter has a $500 game rig running Linux and it runs like a champ, playing BG3 no problem.  Which comes to the other topic... dropping $2000 on a graphics card and/or CPU is pissing money down a rathole.  All you get is the warm fuzzy of being able to get high point count in 3DMark.  If you do drop $5000 on a PC, make sure you get 3dmark so you can max out the warm-fuzzies.  It's seriously pointless.  The best games out there are indies and they run on potatoes.  Yeah it's cool running Minecraft in raytracing... then once the novelty wears off you realize you dropped an insane amount of money and you're still playing minecraft.  The old days of gaining bragging rights has subsided to the fool's badge.  I wear it with honor... but i'm still an idiot.   If you're wanting to get into PC gaming from nothing, get a $500 rig.  Figure out what it's weakest points are and slowly upgrade those pieces.  Don't want to hassle with building, there is Steam Deck and other handhelds that do pretty decently and you can plug them into TV, keyboard and mouse and do everything PC-like.  The advantage of PC though is really it's smaller price tag on games and a lot bigger selection of indie games.

Both Windows PC's, Xbox and Playstation can do free games with a subscription.  With the new cloud service... xbox exclusives can be played streaming on PC or an outdated xbox.

A monitor is literally a base model all feature free television. Framerates, G/F-sync and all of those other things are easily put on a tv (should the producer want). They usually don't because they need you to believe there is value in buying a 1080p or 1440p monitor in 2024. If they can add features you cannot see or touch, and convince you that this specifically is what makes it a ""monitor"", then they can convince people the absurd cost is reasonable considering its a stripped to the bone panel with a power button. 
     In the end, there is no such thing as a a television pixel or a monitor pixel. They are both produced as the same screen. If you think framerates are exclusive to monitors like Jay said, you would be very wrong. I can show you 120,144,240,400,560, and 600hz (600fps) on living room teleivisions  20 years ago that are vastly more capable as a gaming monitor than anything on the market today monitor wise. On top of that high framerates does not produce better gamers or a tactical advantage like its pushed to be as a marketing strategy, or by consumers who are invested in the hype before they realized the hidden nature of marketing jerks. You will never ever see someone produce a better K/D ratio on a first person shooter because he went to 5,000,000 fps versus the guy who went 60fps. 60fps is what you need but 30 will do. I am a PC guy, but without bias I can tell you skilled consolers at 30fps  have been beating the breaks off 144hz and 240hz PC guys since the beginning of gaming. The only (proven) advantage is a mouse. 

  Paying 1000$+ for a 1080p or 1440p monitor that does 240hz is legitimately hilarious. High refresh rates is marketing ploy to sell dated technology equipment at today's price under the pretence it gives an advantage. It doesn't.  It is that simple, so put your money in to actual quality like 4-8K OLED technology where you can actually get a better experience.

Then almost 10 years ago a got a new job where everyone around me played on Playstation 4. And it was a hard (REALLY hard) sell for me to get one, but then I saw the trailer for Horizon Zero Dawn and was kind of star struck if you will... so badly wanted to play that game. So I got a PS4. And then I got lucky and won a small amount of money on a lottery and had just enough to buy a PS4 pro. And I've been hooked on Playstation since. I was lucky enough to get a PS5 just about 1.5 month after release (I ""won"" the rights to buy one). But I haven't abandoned PC. I'm lucky, again, enough to have a well paying job to be able to have both, so last year I got a new gaming pc for somewhere around 24-2500usd and I love it too. I do prefer to sit in my cosy chair and play my ""action"" games on console and big tv, but for me the biggest downer with a console is that they're really not great in any way for strategy games. I played some Civ VI on my PS5 and it's just so.... cumbersome when you don't have mouse and keyboard. Each platform has their uses that they excel at. So my biggest tip would simply to get one of each, if you can afford it. I personally am getting the PS5 pro as soon as it releases 😀",GgJj9Mok9dA,True

@ricosuava21,2024-04-01T23:46:53Z,0,"So for the longest point in time I did play on console. I started out on an Atari I moved up to Nintendo Super Nintendo the regular PlayStation PlayStation 2 Xbox 360 PS4 Xbox One, but I ended up building my own PC. When I actually built my own PC it wasn't just the bug of building the PC that kept me on PC. I made Revelations in those Revelations were exactly this. One the graphics is amazing on PC versus anything on console no matter what game you're playing it's always better on PC the frames per second are much higher to the point that if I have an issue in game that's the game's problem not my PC. Then also yes the initial price for a PC is quite a bit to swallow but when you actually do the math of how much you're going to end up spending on controllers on a new consoles because the consoles break so many different aspects that are issues with consoles in general then you suddenly realize the money you spend on Console gaming is so much higher that it is a lot cheaper to build your own PC and have that set up versus playing on a console and this is the true reality of it. I do wish that consoles could get up to the point of what a PC is, but they never will because to keep a console at a price point they have to use cheap parts and with those sad cheap parts comes cheap part problems. It has gotten to the point that I kind of judge people for playing on Console because I'm sitting there thinking you could just build yourself a gaming PC and be much happier then what you're dealing with with a console because with PC you might have to buy a new keyboard and mouse once every 3 years as long as you treat your stuff with respect where is a console it does not matter how respectful you treat your stuff it is so cheaply made that it ends up breaking on its own and I can promise you that is a reality because even me a person that has controllers from the original PlayStation days and they still work perfect can tell you that these newer generations and consoles are much more fragile I may have never went through controllers on the regular PlayStation but on the Xbox one I went through controller after controller after controller just because of one single game and I'm not a type of person that tears up his controllers that gets expensive after so long to the point that it can overprice a PC build very quickly",GgJj9Mok9dA,True

Negatives of PC. My pc is not top of the line but it’s good enough of last gen that when I upgrade, it’d be a lot of new parts. But that won’t be an issue anytime soon. Other gripe would be buying a game through Steam but having to launch the publisher’s browser and have an account.

1) Higher fidelity in games, no arguing that.
2) A library of available titles that is utterly staggering, with Steam, Epic, EA, and GOG. PC has everything from the latest titles at eye melting graphics all the way back to Command & Conquer and the first point and click adventure titles.
3) Mods for games is more than some monetized DLC in a Bethesda title, it's an entire eco-system changing the littlest details all the way up to adding entirely new stories, assets, characters, and creating a whole new game (Counter Strike was a mod, lest we forget).
4) My PC will do so much more for me, including allowing me to get more involved with my job and take on LoRA, LyCORIS, and checkpoint training for Stable Diffusion.

My Xbox Gamebar (where one engages in Xbox parties/voice chat) has glitched out and, apparently, does not have background permissions, but the ability to give background permissions to apps has been removed. Through all the Googling/research I've done, the only supposed fix I've found (which I have not attempted yet) is to roll Gamebar back to an older build. Rolling programs/apps back to older versions comes with security risks. Yes, games can run better on PC in the Xbox environment, but is it REALLY worth it? Not in my case, in my experience. I'm not saying Xbox on PC sucks, but I'm definitely saying it's WAY more of a headache for some people than it ever should have been allowed to be.

3. A PC is actually also an Xbox and a PlayStation. 5. You can emulate all these games. Yes, it's nice to wait for them to be ported to PC but it's not required.
4. Money's not not a huge obstacle. If it's going towards something that you're passionate about. You shouldn't be worried about spending $2k to $5k on a PC if you truly enjoy gaming and you spend a lot of time doing it, especially if you want the ultimate gaming experience.
5. Lastly, when you build a PC, even if you need help afterwards you feel some sort of accomplishment and it makes playing on it all that more better. You put this thing together. You decided what parts were in it and when it starts working it just feels so good.",GgJj9Mok9dA,True

1. Cheaper games.
2. Better performance. 
3. More ways to play.
4. The customisation of everything. 
5. The learning.
6. Emulation
7. The community
8. Mods
9. Games have more longevity.
10. More immersive 
11. Don't have to pay to play online.
12. I can do a lot more with my PC and do shared things like email easier.
13. Upgradable.
14. All xbox games already and access to GP. PS exclusives are all coming. Helldivers 2 selling more on PC than PS could mean day 1 releases soon.
15. I'm ending here. This can come under customisation but RGB makes everything faster lol.

@HackoDis,2024-04-01T23:09:37Z,0,"Me and a group of people on discord have been having this conversation the biggest issue with the consoles of today is they're lack luster. The ps5 doesn't feel truly next gen, i haven't seen any game that has come out in the last three years that has made me go wow going to buy that day one. 

If we look at gaming it's in shambles right now, Sony has announced a dry spell until 2025 for exclusives. The games that are being launched are too focused on  graphics rather than game play. They're launching in a broken state, which is no good for us. Then WB games pushing for more live service games is just a big NO!!

If the consoles were truly a next gen experience then there might be more hype for them. Right now i have my PC and Nintendo Switch and IMO it's the perfect mix, i get all the Nintendo exclusives and i got my PC for everything else.

The other thing you didn't mention is if and when a ""pro"" version of the console drops, do you sell or trade in your base model ps5 and get the Pro? Who would want the base when you could get the pro for 100 bucks more?

There's alot happening in the gaming industry and we were even saying that it could stumble, nothing like the 80's games crash but we'll see a sharp decline, possibly a few major brands restructure in a big way.",GgJj9Mok9dA,True

Then sometimes log into whatever service you are forced to use to play alot of games. Then question every stutter, frame drop, and fan noise. Also most pcs are too big to use in a small area unless you are using way overpriced small units or just cheap weak small units. So now you need somewhere to store it. Sitting at a desk is a terrible way to game. I want to be in my living room on my 55 inch chilling with the family or friends. Which is why I pc game in my living room now but had to build a custom hutch to house the pc next to the tv. Consoles you stick wherever, turn on controler and bam on your way to 100% optimized gaming in under a minute from the couch. Shut down is faster and easier on console as well. Now you have extra time to game or get back to other things in life. Plus you avoid the dumpster fire of bad ports on pc, the frustration of a 20 apps wanting to update, you don't feel compelled to check things like steam sales or emails. At the end of the day consoles always have been king for gaming. Back when 4 friends were having the best night of their life playing 007 on n64 pc was not as good for gaming as console, and not much has changed since then.
People who play PC games too much always end up being salty sweaty try hard playing FPS like the size of their genitals and bank account depends on it.

Just check steam hardware stats; 2.6ghz intel cpus and 3.3ghz amd cpus are the most used, also the 3060 12gb is still the most used GPU, don't mind the ultra-high-end builds when prices ranges go from $2000 -$4000 leave that to enthusiasts and content creators.",GgJj9Mok9dA,True

Consoles are for people who rarely play, only play a couple of games, or don't care about the lower performance. It's no use really spending the extra money to not ever actually use it. 

One thing people tend to misunderstand is that you dont actually need to upgrade your entire system. My R7 3700X still works. Granted its paired with a 6900XT but at 1440P ultra wide, the GPU is still usually the one at 99% utilization. I paid a lot more than the cost of a console but I'm not upgrading the entire thing on next upgrade. The case, PSU, drives, peripherals and in most cases, the CPU and motherboard, don't need to be upgraded. And you can often times sell the old GPU to get back a little bit.

I'm a PC person with two wildly different systems. 

1 GPD Win Max 2, portable small laptop that great for a lot of things. Being portable being my biggest thing. 30W usage for the entire system means I can go down to the lake sit on a boat playing a game vs fishing irl and having to deal with regulations and fees. I also don't like the taste of fish. But 30W laptop on a small solar panel, I have way more fun with.

The amount of expandability on my home lab is crazy. 3 m.2 drives I have 2 pci x4 slots available that I could use with an oculink drive or just a pcie x4 drive if I needed speed. Adapt to ssd and consider there's 6 ssd ports on the motherboard I could have 12 50Tb drives never run out of space (for my application) and if I do, a 2u NAS is cheap. The drives for it not so much. 

Also sim games. I've never seen a consel racing or flight sim.

A pro for consoles though is there are only a couple hardware variants the devs have to work with. With pc there are far more hardware pieces that the game needs to be optimized for.

Nvidia basically not releasing an affordable option for 12gb+ of VRAM with actual good performance along with so many PC ports these days having poor optimization, completely relying on stuff like DLSS and frame generation just to ""work properly"".

The console fanboys love to pretend that you have to spend $5000 for a gaming PC when that's not even close to being true. You can still build a very capable gaming machine for around a grand that puts consoles to shame. After you account for annual fees to play online with a console, higher game prices, and ridiculously priced peripherals consoles will quickly get every bit or even more expensive than a PC. I've spent $150 on Switch controllers alone because of stick drift. Then you have mods, emulation, and a ridiculously monstrous amount of backwards compatible games. Gaming on PC brings _freedom_ to do what you want when you want without getting Sony, Nintendo, or MS's permission.

All this without mentioning you pretty much _NEED_ a PC in 2024. I'm not doing my taxes, paying bills, or applying for a home improvement loan on a f*cking Playstation or 6"" phone screen. The only difference in a PC and a ""gaming"" PC is a few hundred dollar GPU, and I guarantee every console fanboy _wishes_ they had a gaming PC, but they made the mistake of buying a cheap laptop that can't be upgraded so claiming consoles are better is simply sour grapes. 

This is the first console generation that I haven't bought a PS or XB, and honestly I don't miss them one bit. Even my Switch rarely gets powered up because Switch games simply run _better_ on PC.

Stellar Blade has no release date for PC yet. However, the PS5 version runs at 60fps and looks really good so day 1 on console. 

Don’t sleep on PS exclusives on PS5. Many are patched for PS5 and games like Gran Turismo, GoWR, HFW, Ratchet and Spiderman all have uncapped frames modes for those with VRR. Its a solid place to play. I say that as a 7600x/7900xt PC owner.

Back compat is way better this gen Jay. Series S/X has FPS Boost program with many older games that are boosted. Also, older games are boosted to 16x AF standard as well as autoHDR. 
PS5’s is only good for PS4 games but it will boost up games that can’t hit their frames up to its cap. Also, if you play a game with a PS4 version like Elden Ring where the perf is not to the frame cap with the PS5 version, then you can run the PS4 version and have a locked experience.

@Zinkhal1,2024-04-01T22:33:29Z,0,"1:54 i am always for pc i just own a nintendo switch .. and playstation 2 (and every conoles of the brand before that ..xD) but pc was always my main plattform ... but in that case i would say the PS5 is maybe a better idea it could be a good opportunity to use it with your kids ... in most cases you cant do that on pc .. especially not with just 1 pc ... and if its just for 1 person its just the question how much do you want to pay and what do you want to do .. if you just want to game a bit after work or something and not more you dont really need a pc ... especially in view of some problems that a pc in some cases have with some games and stuff there are way less problems with consoles for a cassual gamer 
7:55 and there is one of the reasons why i stopped at the PS2 xD funny but i love the fact that i can play PS1 title on my PS2 ... even if i still own BOTH of them working and most of the time they were both fully installed ..xD another reason was the price in my opinion they just charged way too much for it especially after a bit of time ... i got my PS2 in 2005 for under 200€ ... yes the console was old at that point ... but there was not even close a PS3 in 2010 for 200 to 300€ ... so the price was just about doubled 
11:00 well i use parts especially cpu and gpu for around 5 years was a bit unlucky with cpu but at the gpu part of things i had a gtx 660 in 2013 then a gtx 960 in 2017 and then a rx 6600 in 2022 .. both the gtx was 200€ the 6600 was 260€ ... with cpu and mainboards it would be somewhat the same again my old one was a i5 6500 dont ask me for the motherboard something from gigabyte ..xD and now its a ryzen 5 5600x with an asus tuf gaming b550 plus motherboard ... so IF the consoles wouldnt break they would be cheaper in that time 
at the same time i have just fun at building even if its for me cause of medical issues physically a bit of trouble sometimes .. i would never say no to building a system if i can ;D
16:00 well .. according to google that the ps5 use up to 200 watt while gaming i dont get far above that with 61 watt on the cpu and 101 watt on the gpu on max just cap the fps a bit reduce the gpu down to around 60 ...nothing else in my system is special and yes its most likely above 200 but not a huge amount ... at the same time i have to say my cpu and gpu are undervolted in stock they would use a bit more so while you can get a system using around the same amount of power even on pc compared to a ps5 you most likely have to tune it for that purpose 
19:18 well let me try to find 5 reasons for both sides because i own both start with pc because the title of the video also start with pc xD 
1.the universal use in my case especially gaming on 1 side and play a video on another display at the same time
2.if something break its not 100% of the original price because its just 1 part
3.same with the upgrades its just 200 or 300€ .. or maybe even just 50€ not over 400€
4.some games are better with keyboard and mouse and some with a gamepad ... and yes the concoles started with that aswell now but not for all titles and just now not 10 years ago as far as i know thats still a problem in some titles there
5.i love to build the systems :D
i ignore points like the selection of your voice programm with friends and stuff .. while a friend last year still had to use his mobile phone for discord while playing final fantasy 14 on playstation not a big problem if you never was a pc gamer to know a lot pc gamer with different voice programms and stuff ..xD

and for the console
1.its kinda cheap to get
2.nothing to do just plug and play
3.the performance will not be bad because of ""not optimize for your specific cpu or gpu""
4.easy to use on a tv and dont need a lot of other ""items"" at home
5.the exclusives alone could be worth it ... pokemon is the only reason i own a nintendo switch for example .. i own more then 20 games for it so yes its obviously not just used for that reason :D

funny but it was by far more simple to find the reasons for consoles then for pc ... maybe because i know why i use consoles while i use my pc just every day for all type of stuff? 


and at the end i have to say ... i dont care where you play just do it .. i never liked all the console wars maybe because just of myself or because i grew up with nintendo and playstation and pc at home because of the family my father had always a pc and nintendo ... my mother liked the playstation so i was able to use them all and learn to love them on their own special way of doing their stuff .. in the end a console is just easier in most ways and yes in a lot of things you giving up some advantages compared to pc .. but is that really a bad thing? or is it more like a normal thing ... its more expensive so you can expect it to be able to do more .. but if you dont need this ""more"" it could be just like throwing away your money xD

Pros:
1) push button, turns on, play game
2) can do a little more than gaming (just like any smart TV out there)
3) easy to use overall

Cons:
1) one controller option to play every single game, or buy overpriced licensed stuff like fighting sticks and steering wheels, almost zero keyboard & mouse support.
2) can't keep the games from previous generations, each console is a closed ecosystem, you spend 500 bucks + a ton of money in games and when the next gen comes out you gotta sell at a huge loss if you don't want to be left behind
3) it not a guaranteed ""good optimization"" seal of approval anymore, games come out with a bad performance regardless of platform

PC

Pros:
1) freedom of hardware and peripherals in general, use any keyboard & mouse you want for shooters, use any steering wheel for sim racing or even arcade racing if the game supports it, use any fighting stick you want for fighting games. Want to fly? Use any flight stick to pilot flight sims or even arcade flying games. You prefer a controller, buy any controller from any brand you want, you can find better controller which are ""stick drift proof"" for half the price of an original console controller.
2) you get to keep all the games you've bought over the years, PC is future proof, you can play the very first game ever and the very last in the same machine, you are free to use emulators as well, no limitations whatsoever.
3) you can do so much more than gaming and you can customize it to your heart's content, give it your own style, choose it's aesthetics. Use it for work, use it for studies, do whatever, be free.
4) it's upgradable, you don't need to sell it and buy a new one, you can upgrade it over time. A console always have a finite number of units made, PC is infinite.

Cons:
1) can be quite expensive to get into (depends on the hardware and your goal)
2) can be daunting for newcomers that don't understand much (but you can take your time to learn)
3) not that straightforward to use, a little more advanced, and if you are not careful you could get some viruses in your machine (generally common sense will be enough to keep you safe, you'll only be in danger if you do something stupid)",GgJj9Mok9dA,True

PC: when starting a build from 0 with 0 pc experience its hella scary. I was so scared to buy a MB that did not support my CPU once i learned that its not a one size fits all. Does my PSU deliver enough power? Basics like this. Then you learn a little bit and fall i to the dunning Kruger effect. Hard. How does my ram speed compare. How to do stuff in bios. Does this part have any issues with this part. Does my cpu fan fit in the case. And of course. The front pannel connector. The pros, there are way more niece games. Certain games are just better with Mouse and KB. Minecraft, strategy Games, football Manager for example. And in general games look better.

PS5: i only need to look at games and not requirements. I HONESTLY never had an issue with my refresh rate even with Games i own on both platforms. I still think its a ""PC master Race i build pcs and its the only thing that gives my life meaning"" kinda argument. I like the gaming on my couch feeling.

Is it the latest tech? Is the Playstation? Neither is, but the difference is that he can upgrade the PC if he wishes. You may look down on such a machine but it will do the job for him and it's not just a device to consume content.

I think you have to look further into the personal ecosystem. If you buy a consol, it's not going to be your only digital device. If you just live with a consol and a phone then it's probably going to be a decent (expensive) phone. You may feel the need to spring for a laptop because you write. A PC is all things. It doesn't have a specific purpose, I game on mine but I also write music with Reaper. I design custom products for myself and a small group of clients with 3D printing.

@R0D3R1CKV10L3NC3,2024-04-01T22:19:07Z,0,"Honestly, I've had every Playstation console since I got my first PSX for Christmas as a kid way back in the late 90s, and I've always enjoyed the Playstation exclusive games, and the convenience of just having a console hooked up to my TV to play with a controller, with - at least before the move towards digital - the ease of just throwing in a disk and turning on the console being all it took to start up, rather than having to install the game, and usually go through whatever kind of set-up to make sure the graphics, controls, and any other settings are correct (at minimum) with any game I would play on all the PCs I had from the time I was about 15 or 16 and built my first computer for myself.

I've always been happy to have both since, because certain types of games just work better with mouse and keyboard, or are only available on PC, so I play them there, while any games that are only available on Playstation consoles, or are better with controllers (because I find Playstation controller support on PC is still sometimes iffy and I absolutely do not like the feel of, nor do I want to buy an Xbox controller just to connect to my PC for a handful of games), I tend to prefer to play on Playstation. Sure, if I never bought any Playstations over the years, I could have upgraded my PC a bit more and had a slightly better one at different times, but in the long run, I think I was much happier with having the Playstations over the years than I ever would have been with slightly better PCs.

I think that, in all honesty, if someone has a limited budget, and doesn't want to risk going with used parts and/or building something themself, but *absolutely* wants to get something to game on, then a console is definitely the way to go, but realistically the ideal situation is getting both, if you can. But, if none of the Playstation exclusive games really interest you (or the Nintendo exclusives, as a Switch is also a perfectly good console to have as a compliment to a gaming computer), then yeah, just make sure you're doing the smart thing and spending the money on the right parts, and setting yourself an easy upgrade path, and go all-in on PC. But anyone who doesn't have interest in any of the console exclusives really shouldn't have any troubles deciding on the debate between PCs and consoles, at that point, the decision should already be made in their mind.",GgJj9Mok9dA,True

Now the generation after me might be the complete opposite, they can’t game unless it’s on a controller, and unless you are an FPS snob it makes no sense to buy a gaming PC to play your games with an Xbox controller.",GgJj9Mok9dA,True
@XDM_Studios,2024-04-01T22:16:44Z,0,"1.(Collective organization and unification) For me I had originally joined the PC Master race because I was lazy. I grew tired of every time I wanted to play something I would have to unhook up a console put the wires away plug in the new console I want to play switch to disc plug in the controllers and be on my way I wanted everything in one centralized place I already used my computer so I wanted to have everything in one location. All digital all in one location.
2. (The lifespan of physical media) Physical media would get damaged, scratched, dirty or lost. 
3.(The customization and graphical capability)As I got more into it I realized how the performance and graphics became a benefactor of me staying here. 
4.(License agreements and terminations AKA Bans)Another reason for PC against consoles are if whatever reason under the Sun your console gets banned that's it you have a gigantic paperweight that you can't do anything with especially if you went digital. that itself is a big price to pay to have a $500 paperweight. 
5.(Repairability and upgradability)
 finally some may find it overwhelming for the amount of pieces that you can change or replace in the PC but on that very same note if one component breaks on my computer I can replace that one component versus a console most likely need to be completely thrown away and replaced.",GgJj9Mok9dA,True

 If you want to do more than game, then the obvious choice would be PC. As you mentioned, be ready to pay for it. 
  Honestly, I've been thinking of buying a PC here lately due to having access to Playstation and Xbox games in one place! Both companies are dropping their ganes on PC now anyways. Already priced the PC and it would be $1,100 for a long-term 1440p PC that plays games easily with very high frame rates. That price needs to come down a bit, and even if I did go for it, I will have it hooked to a 120hz 65in TV with controller in hand for gaming only.

@splynncryth,2024-04-01T22:07:40Z,0,"I've been a PC gamer at heart for a long time. But there was a stint where I was playing on consoles. Now that I've been back to PC gaming for the past few years I have some thoughts on both.

On the PC, you get to 'own' your gaming experience. I don't mean with custom hardware (though that is a part of it), I mean the software. Mods, save editors, and other tools to help tailor your single player experience so it's actually fun (especially as I get older meaning my gaming sessions are shorter and more infrequent). 

The ability to back stuff up. for the main game I've been playing with for a while, about once a month someone on Reddit will lament about a lost save without any way to recover it. And with physical media basically being dead, backing games up is maybe the next best thing. 

Using something other than a controller to play a game isn't considered cheating on PCs. 

With a little work, a PC can be used much like a console. This could be with software on the gaming PC, or via streaming with something like a low cost PC or streaming device like a Shield TV.

Retro gaming. Emulation is a gray area due to ownership but there is no online store to get shut down forcing you to rebuy the same game over and over just to keep playing it. And for older games, they still work on current hardware in a way that we don't see with consoles (if they even decide to try and have some level of reverse compatibility).

I also wouldn't say cost is a huge negative for PCs at this point. Many channels (including this one) have shown how to build a gaming rig on a budget, especially for those confident enough to delve into the second-hand market. And for those with enough patience to fiddle, Arc is another great thing for budget PC gaming. 

PCs also allow for new things to be tried. The current trend in handhelds that have been inspired by Nintendo shows the power of a platform that isn't really owned by any single entity. 


But consoles have their good points too.

The uniform hardware and input devices make it easier for developers to develop a consistent experience (though it still requires them to put in the work to make it good). This means a more consistent experience for users and in a competitive environment, this may also seem to make the experience more fair.

At least with Xbox, online gaming is a more streamlined experience along with its built-in communications capabilities. I will refrain from saying the experience is good (just consider the stereotype of boys running their mouths during a match), it's just more integrated, simpler, and more unified.

Knowing things will 'just work' with a console can be great. While a PC can get here, it takes a bit more education for PCs to be something users don't need to sweat over.

Consoles are generally easier to fit in with a home entertainment center both in terms of physical form factor and style (though the PS5 might be the exception to this rule).

Power use and efficiency may become bigger positives in the future. Right now I'd say this is a minor advantage but living in an area with high electric rates is giving me a better appreciation for efficient hardware, at least in comparison to some of the power hogs in a gaming PC (cough nvidia cough).


Overall, I think the ownership issues are what will keep me in the PC ecosystem. The Steam Deck has made it even easier to be a PC gamer too.",GgJj9Mok9dA,True

@miiDEATON,2024-04-01T22:03:59Z,0,"No offense Jay, but I think you could have went in depth a bit more to really show the differences. What is interesting in current times, as seen from the issues of this generation, is that now it's the games that make one platform more sought after than the other. I will say that PC is absolutely hands down better in every aspect (except just one and that is plug and play like you said), and I agree that you have to fork over over $1,000 for an optimal and worthy experience. Consoles nowadays primarily exist for kids and teens who don't have the means to pay for a PC yet and want to play games. The worst is how online experiences are greedily locked behind subscriptions, and the price after 5 years of use equates to a decent PC's price, with the console's cost included. I see no reason anymore to own consoles with the sky being the limit for PC use and I regret purchasing this generation's products. I enjoyed Ratchet and Demon's Souls on PS5 and I guess it's nice to play all my Xbox games on one newer console, but there is genuinely no point in owning these anymore if they are going to become paperweights for several months or years at a time. I can play 90%+ games with better quality and sustainability from every generation, while the big three companies want you to move on from older games and forget they existed. Hopefully AMD stays awesome so that upgrading to higher end parts every 7+ years stays cost effective because NVIDIA is making it harder to stay on top of owning a high end GPU without paying way more than they're worth.",GgJj9Mok9dA,True

Not all games let you turn off motion blur and depth of field and a host of other options on a console as available on a PC.  I've been with Xbox since their beginning.  I switch to PS4 for their games.  Then learned I can backup my saves to USB which the Xbox does not allow.  When PS5 came along I switch to PC because the PS5 does not allow me to backkup my saves to USB.  Why this is a big deal is the number of saves for most games are finite which means you have to overwrite old ones.  Backing up to USB solves that problem.  I also use this to backup auto-saves by quitting in a middle of a fight which normally does not allow you to manually save.  Now on a PC I can replay key events which don't have manual saves.,GgJj9Mok9dA,True

It's fun trying to troubleshoot and look up solutions in forums. Maybe I just like looking for problems in a new build, which is a niche in its own, because most people, and I say at least 98% of PC owners just want their stuff to work after putting it together and seeing it POST for the first time.

They don't bother with settings like Intel's power limits, AMD's PBO tuning with curve optimizer, overclocking GPU core and memory to the absolute limit, undervolting GPU to prevent hitting power limit (*cough* 3080 and 3090 owners am I right?). All those things I've found fun in, compared to actually playing on the PC! The process of squeezing out every bit of performance is what pulls me into the PC ecosystem. The average Joe coming home from work will just want to play games and relax. Not scratching their head why their computer is rebooting randomly when they set their curve optimizer value/overclock too aggressively.

Consoles are plug and play, same things with a properly specced pc, provided you don't pair a 4090 and an i3. Both will do you wonders for years to come! Go console if you do strictly gaming. PC can work too if you only do strictly gaming, but the initial price will creep up compared to console, but it'll open up lots of options if you see a good sale on hardware on either the new or used market.

Straight up, my PC is for business or the like. It is basic, it was cheap as dirt and it does the job perfectly. Not having to trust and download a bunch of different launchers or sign up to them is to me a big deal.

Yes I could use secondary hard drive with virtual machines to be more secure but to run all that plus a game means even more money to handle it.

Wireless keyboards, mics and so on are perfect for use to for Xbox. Also tbh my PS2 from early 2k still works as does my 360. However I have gone through 3 different PCs during these decades where I only ever needed one console a decade+.

Avoid consoles at all costs if you're going to have that as your only gaming option.

@brennanIX,2024-04-01T21:47:37Z,0,"Honestly,  you can't really compare  like apples to apples. It's like asking what's better a car or motorcycle. Yeah, they're both motorized vehicles, just like consoles and PC are electronics devices, but they aren't really interchangeable.

A motorcycles is cool, and simple, and more affordable, but they're also just more of a toy with a more focused, singular use case. If never suggest someone gets a motorcycles unless they already have a car. I mean, really it's either both or just a car.

However, if you were really limited on funds, space, needed something ASAP, and had a good deal on a motorcycle, you could technically make it work for the most part. It just wouldn't be ideal, and there would be obvious sacrifices you're making.

Similar for console to PC. You can get a used console for under $200. If you REALLY need a gaming machine, don't have a place to put a PC, and no real expendable income, at least you could have SOMETHING with a console.

The only way I'd really recommend a console outright is for children. If you have kids and they wanna game, DEFINITELY get a console. A PC can be a bit overwhelming for kids, and need more maintenance and care, and you can mess it up poking around where you shouldn't be. As long as a console can breathe, it'll keep on ticking, and you can't actually mess anything up since it's pretty locked down. A PC would still be a way cooler gift, but it could be a headache for the parent. Additionally, since most kids have consoles, and not everything is cross play, a console might be a safer bet for them to play with the most friends. Then once they hit 13 or so, if recommend the PC.",GgJj9Mok9dA,True

@moveit124,2024-04-01T21:47:02Z,0,"One of my biggest points to the ""Console vs PC"" thing - is always the sales...

Yes the initial cost to get into PC is way higher, 3-6x as much depending on how beefy a PC you get.  But it will pay itself off in a matter of a few years just in the amount of sales on Steam.  Like right at this moment their is a sale going on... Cyberpunk, No Mans Sky, Death Stranding, Satisfactory... are all 50% off right now and those aren't even ""good"" sales.  I've been able to purchase games that are 60 dollars on console for like 6-7 dollars on PC.  

And on top of that... all of those games you buy on sale or whatever... stay on your PC forever (well until Steam dies, which lets face it probably isn't happening anytime soon lol)... I have a library of 600 games over the last 12 years and I can still play them all.

Another thing is ... Average lifecycle of a PC is around 5 years, but you can sell that PC to someone else and recoup half that cost to buy a new PC typically.  OR you can take and use it as a NAS or Server or so many other things... I have all of my gaming PC's over the last 12 years and they all serve specific functions within my household and couldn't do without any of them.",GgJj9Mok9dA,True

@TheGamefaq,2024-04-01T21:32:04Z,1,"Jay you say Xbox and PC are the same.

I disagree and I intentionally bought an Xbox Series X instead of a PS5.
Because you do NOT have all xBox games for the PC even if there is the Xbox app for Windows. On the contrary, there are even titles that are only available for the XBox PC app or xBox console.
There is also the Xbox Gamepass = flat rate for playing and it pays off no matter which of the 3 versions (only for console, only for PC or for both = Ultimate) you use. Because you get significantly more good games included in the year than you spend on the game pass. Especially after the recent price increases where the standard version of a console game costs €80/$80. The Gamepass Ultimate only costs €180/$180 per year, which wouldn't even be 3 new console games a year, or even if they only cost €60/$60, exactly 3 a year! And you have the money back for the game pass. But here you can try out games endlessly and, more importantly, for longer than 2 hours like on Steam, where many of the games keep you in character creation and/or prologue for exactly that time and you couldn't see the right, permanently relevant game content or the Endgame content. To know if it's worth buying for you. What is particularly important with the masses of multiplayer titles is that they are all great at first and only after a few hours, then the gameplay becomes boring... This risk is eliminated with Gamepass.

The important exclusive PS5 games, on the other hand, are now coming to the PC at the same time (e.g. Helldivers 2) or with a delay of around 1 year (then add-ons/DLC's such as Horizon Forbidden West Complete Edition). So why do “I” need a Playstation5? I emphasize the ""I"" because I've been out of the kiddy age for decades and don't have to have every game straight away and certainly not most of the purely children's games (whether on Xbox or PS) or exaggeratedly Asian-flavored titles with their Googly eyes etc.

For me as an adult, the Xbox SeriesX was the logical choice, partly because of Gamepass Ultimate.
Because I can play many of the games on PC or console or both alternately and play the same game state. Or even via the cloud (also the same game status!) on a PC that doesn't actually have the power for it. Because cloud gaming is also included in Gamepass Ultimate! A few weeks ago you bought 2 MiniPCs to test. On one of them, which was technically perfect under Windows, you can use it to play PC games via the cloud with the Xbox app, which it itself technically couldn't display! Example ""A Plague Tale: Requiem"" which even requires a relatively powerful PC!

Which also answers the title of your video...BOTH! :)

If you then really want to play the couple of sony exclusives, 450 bucks on top of your 2k gaming pc won't make that big of a difference. 
If you however are on a budget, then there is good points to make for either. 
By buying a PS5 ($450), you have everything you need except for a monitor and games. +$100 monitor/tv
A gaming laptop with a 4060 ($800) performs better than a ps5, is portable and can do much more, while also not requiring a monitor/tv. It does however (imo) at least need either a controller or mouse to properly be utilized for gaming. +$40 controller (xbox)
A gaming pc can be built to match the PS5 with everything you need, for as low as $650 (potentially even lower with sales/bundles/used gpu). However it requires peripherals and a monitor. +$100 monitor +~$30 peripherals (barebones budget ones)

So approximately $310 more for a gaming laptop or $230 for a desktop pc. This makes the console the more attractive option on a budget. 

However, the PS5 can only be used for gaming, videos, music and some light web browsing. You can't run any other software, upgrade parts in the future, the image quality is worse, you are locked to certain settings, no modding and more.

$230 is approximately the equivalent of 4 AAA games. While I was living worse off money wise, I saved much, much more on games than that by doing the naughty. This is also why I'd always recommend a pc to those on a low budget. While the hardware might be slightly more expensive, console stores are arranged in a way to squeeze you dry with games, especially during sales. On PC you can always just not **cough** buy them.",GgJj9Mok9dA,True

 Top 5 reasons pc: 
Utility
Options to upgrade by choice
versatility
Graphics
Better game experience - better games

 Console:
Convenient
less space
Old consoles- that feeling of popping in a cartridge, pulling it out and blowing the dirt out (LOL like it helps) and it actually helps.
I can sit and play the switch with my entire family at once- Mario and Zelda titles would never feel like they do on the switch or game cube/ game boy (every variation)


 I could come up with 5 better reasons for the pc over the consoles.  Consoles only ever had 2 real pros and it was playing multiplayer without being online and not being online to play the game. That has changed and it makes every PS and Xbox post PS3 and the 360 pointless and shit. We have several children that all have different consoles but the one thing in common in the house is we have 7 pcs- everyone ends up on a laptop or gaming rig over their selected consoles majority of the time.

@warhead173,2024-04-01T21:14:57Z,0,I personally choose pc as my daily because its everything in one.  However at the same time I have to give people who prefer console some slack because they say just buying a console every 7 ish years is ok with them because its way simpler to just come home from work turn it on and play. For the average user out of my 10 ish pc friends at least 7 of them end up with issues because you can do so much with a pc conflicting software being the biggest one.  Alot of time resulting in a windows corruption and needing a reinstall which me personally I am ok with. However on console you just log back into the system and clips for example are saved to the cloud now so you don't really lose anything. In terms of quality comparison the xbox and ps5 offer amazing looking experiences not as much as pc but that comes down to standards. Still a really solid experience. Something I have experienced myself and is why I bought a ps4 second hand is because the loss of progress. About a year ago I really missed playing black ops 3 and blackout on ps4 which both games r dead on pc. The itch never got scratched until I got another console. I have had my ps account since 2008 and xbox account since 2005. They hold value to me because I have done so much on them and in alot of cases that doesn't transfer to pc.

Great video as always. :)

I myself prefere PC's
1) can learn programming and development tools
2) can learn electronics where you have development cards and devices that can be connected to PC
3) the upgradablility path of PC's to keep software and old games.  Example I still play the original DOOM, DOOM2, Quake 2, and other old games which is harder to do on consoles unless the console manufacturer has it on their legacy store
4) customizability of PC's and creativity of cases and custom builds people do.
5) Being able to run multiple types of OS's on PC's of your choice vs consoles.  Some consoles the companies try to sue their customers for trying to jail break their devices.

There are probably more reasons I could come up with, but these are what are at the top of the list for me.",GgJj9Mok9dA,True

@TheObsesedAnimeFreaks,2024-04-01T21:08:57Z,0,"Me arguing with peeps over ""whether or not PS5 is successful."" 
Like there's a lot of issues with PS5, I don't think it's been selling at the same pace the PS4 did, or the PS3 for that matter, and many of the games on PS5 that are ""exclusive"" just haven't been selling well. That's ignoring the censorship and other aspects that just make Sony out to be a terrible company to work with or even be a customer of. 
PC isn't much better in terms of what MS is doing with windows and some of the other drama and things happening with steam, epic and the like. the advantage to PC is generally the freedom that comes with it, and generally just a lot more games overall. But the cost of having to know what you are doing to use linux, or the same with windows is just not very compelling to a lot of people. so they prefer a console over a PC. 
What really annoys me is the fact that people just jump to hating on xBox or PS5, OR PC for like no real reason. then getting into arguments with those people pointing out that their grass is just as repugnant as the other side's, get me accused of caring about the ""platform wars"" or an ""xBox Fanboy"" or being a ""PCMR supporter"" like... come on, while I do think PC is just generally better, i'm not blind by the fact that just because I like PC and like the freedom i have with it, that a Console can't fill someone's needs. i know for a fact that consoles are very much a selling point for people that just don't care. but I'm the type of person that want's people to be informed about what they are buying and aren't just jumping on a band wagon.",GgJj9Mok9dA,True

You also completely left the subsctiptions out of your cost analysis. A PS5 after 5 years of the $75/yr subscription is almost $900, which you can build a totally respectable PC for that will easily outperform a PS5.

Your arguments about power consumption and size is just objectively untrue. If anything, a PC can be more efficient than a console since you have full control over power limits and voltage curves.

From what I can remember I did this for about 10 yrs and finally went back to consoles just because I wanted to pick up and play without the hassle from driver issues or having to upgrade parts.

@malkmusRules,2024-04-01T21:00:57Z,0,"Will be interesting to see how the ARM chips for Windows will affect console development. If the SOC's GPU portion runs quick enough, in theory it should bring down the prices of consoles and Windows on ARM systems not using a dGPU since you won't need a motherboard per se. But of course, fixed memory, fixed CPU, fixed GPU ala Apple's M series is terrible for upgrades and flexibility which ultimately raises the price of computing should you need to upgrade. Not an issue with consoles of course.

I've had both. The racing sims I play are, with the exception of one title, are not available. Buy all games on Steam sales. I'd pick PC because:

a. consoles I had were used for about 3 months before they joined the dust heap
b. PCs are upgradeable to an extent, particularly if you're in early with an AMD based system and of course you can always get a new GPU if needed.
c. Capability: PCs, as everyone knows, can do more than games. A lot more. We could be using our system for something we never thought of at the time of purchase. They're also reusable. Turn on old system into a NAS or TV Box, etc.
d. Catalog; On the PC, you can emulate tons of old systems from Amigas to older consoles etc. As said in the video, more titles that were exclusively console based are coming to the PC. You can even run old DOS games if you want.
e. Modding and Updates: Again, may be out of date here but some sims I play that are close to a decade old but still get mods and updates both from the publisher and the larger community to an extent I haven't seen on consoles.

The pros of a computer are: you can get one for the same price as a console and it can play the majority of games at med graphics, you can play games at higher fps, you can mod, you have all the other benefits if being on a pc and you can upgrade easily and don’t need to dump thousands all at once.

@DrJ3RK8,2024-04-01T20:56:23Z,0,"I use a PC on my 86"" living room TV, and another in my office/studio, and the kids all have nice PCs, etc.  There's a PC in just about every room of the house.  The I have an M3 Macbook Pro, a MiSTer FPGA (sometimes two as I like to build them) and an Analogue Pocket, four or five Switches in the house, etc.  I wouldn't replace the PC with a PS5/XBox myself ever.  However, I would highly recommend one of the ""big"" consoles for people that maybe aren't into building PCs.  IMO people that don't want to BUILD PCs, probably shouldn't own them either.  Just way more to think about for someone that may not want to think about it.  I think recommending things that won't cause people headaches (that aren't INTO the headaches 😁 ) is a good idea.  That also makes it so that you aren't instantly their tech support staff.  :D  Not that PCs are much of a headache anymore, but there is still a lot more potential for issues than just plugging a console in.  I'd never trade my PCs for consoles, (though I don't mind supplementary consoles) but for other people consoles may make more sense.

Also, one of my daughters did exactly the same thing.  I've built my kids PCs since they were arguably too small to use them :D but one of them just wanted to do the whole build process herself.  I bought her a nice set of parts, trickled her PC down to the next kid, (then the bottom ones go out to friends and extended family) and she built it herself.  Wanted me there, but wouldn't let me do a single thing for her.  Was quite fun, and one of those proud dad moments.  :D",GgJj9Mok9dA,True

@loudryka,2024-04-01T20:52:53Z,0,"I recently tried this out. I had a PC with an RTX 4060 and a 5600x3d CPU. I sold it on Facebook marketplace for $1,200 and got myself an Xbox series. X for $300 at Staples. I thought I could make the switch over but it was such a bad experience. I'm a keyboard and mouse player so the mouse would constantly just stop during a match of call of duty and I have to restart to console. Also, I have a 1440p monitor that's 165 hz but the Xbox would not do 1440p 120 Hertz. It always just said that the resolution was not supported. So I had to play at 1080p which was much blurrier than I was used to. I also did not want to rebuy buy a lot of my games. So I went online and built something with the ryzen 3700X and a 1080 TI for about $400. Thanks to FSR I'm able to game at 1440p about 140 FPS in call of duty which is fine for me

Also, none of my headsets would work with the console. I had a couple Corsair and Astros. But you have to have a certain type. Then I had to have a regular headset with a 3.5 mm jack plugged into my controller while I was using mouse and keyboard so it was just very awkward",GgJj9Mok9dA,True

@Gamer-q7v,2024-04-01T20:51:35Z,0,"PC gaming is definitely better if performance and graphics are your top priorities. It's also much better if you are into customisation and modding. With PC gaming, you get to choose what components go into your PC as long as they are compatible with each other, obviously, and there is no noticeable bottleneck. PC gaming also offers customisation of how you can play games. You can use a wider variety of peripherals on a PC, such as a keyboard and mouse, a controller, and even a dedicated racing setup for racing games. It's very versatile. Modding is another big advantage for PC gaming, as you have the ability to modify video games to make the experience especially suited to your likings. You can also add extra content with mods, and you can mod for various other reasons. With consoles, there is very limited mod support, and you don’t get that customisation option with consoles. It's just the same old black or white box that everyone has, so it's not unique. PC also offers customisation for in game settings, which I really like. The five major advantages of PC gaming are performance, graphics, modding, customisation, and versatility. Console gaming, however, is better for plug and play as you don't have to worry about technical tasks like updating drivers and the BIOS and ensuring that all hardware and software are compatible. Console gaming doesn't require as many technical skills as PC gaming does. Both have their pros and cons, and which one is better depends on your preferences.",GgJj9Mok9dA,True

It is true that with PC you can upgrade components overtime, whereas on console you are locked other than storage.
With the PS5 Slim though we now have a modular disc drive as an option so if the disc drive wears down we can replace that disc drive.
Pretty soon we'll probably be able to upgrade the RAM modules.

however imho it really depends on your use case, if you only WANT to play a few hours per month buy a console if you want to play a lot with mods, mmos with lots of friends, music/video production etc. then PC is defiantly the best choice. 

for me PC is my creative space, i do music production (bedroom producer) lol, so i cant really do that on a console, but i love customizing my pc with RGB, nice cases etc., obviously i do game on my PC, so its got the power to do so.

my biggest issue with console ( and this is on Xbox tbh) is proprietary bullshit like the crap storage upgrade MS did. at least with Sony they gave the option of a standard NVME drive to upgrade, however with NVME storage being pretty cheap nowadays i cant fathom why only 1 tb of internal storage was used in both consoles considering the size of most AAA games nowadays.

@sethharrison2284,2024-04-01T20:46:22Z,0,"As someone who owns a PS5 and PC, don't buy into the hype of this console generation. Yes, with a PC and console at a comparable price point, the console will probably perform better at 4k. But higher ends PC's are much better for gaming. Why? The current console generation is pushing out some really good graphics, but only at 30 FPS at 4k and even then we have seen performance issues. The ""performance mode"" options for consoles essentially gives you last gen graphics but 60 FPS. If you are playing at 1440p instead, a PC is a better investment at similar prices points to the consoles. The only scenario a console is better is if you HAVE to play at 4k and don't want to pay more for a PC. However, you're getting a console that is extremely limited and you have to pay a monthly subscription fee for online multiplayer. A higher end PC is capable of better 4k performance than a console, does not require monthly subs, and will also give a pretty solid machine for whatever else you could need a computer for.

Yes, console can be limiting if the games get more demanding. However, here are the reasons why I think consoles are better:

1: They are not as expensive as PCs, so it's a much easier way of getting into gaming as a whole.
2: Besides work, consoles can do as much as a PC can in terms of gaming, multimedia, and streaming services.
3: It works right out of the box. All I need to do is plug it in, install games, and I'm off to the races.
4: For PlayStation and Nintendo, there are great exclusives you cannot get on PC. (Yes, PlayStation has games on PC, but not all)
5: Consoles have more games with a physical disk, so even if it's merely a license, you own it.
6: Only one store for all you need for your games.

But for the benefits of a PC however:

1: You can use it for work and play without having to use another device for one or the other.
2: You can choose what parts you want for it.
3: There are games on PC that are not on console that aren't anything to scoff about.

Personally, I am a console gamer through and through. I prefer the ease of use. I like what consoles bring, as long as it isn't detrimental or useless to the consumer. I do like PCs for their custom rigs and how they look, but I don't see myself getting a PC to play games on it, period. I'm just gonna stick with consoles 'till the end.",GgJj9Mok9dA,True

PC if you want to go with more game choices and possibly better graphics and fps depending on what you're willing to pay. PC gaming is the more expensive choice right off the get but you can usually upgrade fairly cheaply also depending on your choice of setup. PC is alot more complicated than console gaming too in alot of situations. If you're not PC saavy then you better learn if you wanna PC game and get the most out of it.

@jacopowell4151,2024-07-30T16:19:14Z,1,Pc will allways be the best.. i used to play on pc then went to console.. going back to pc now. The reason i say this. The problem Is more game (and developer) related. You can not mod on a xbox the same as pc (gta role play.. carx.. snow runner.. acc..).. you can not sim race with propper equipment(moza r5 to r21.. sim magic.. fannetch..) on console.. updates always takes anywere from 2 days to 1 year to release after a pc update( carx racing online).. you get way more better game titels.. euro truck sim.. american truck sim.. i racing.. acc with mods.. sqauds.. body cam.. the list gos on and on.. and games are cheaper on steam. Then the major upset is xbox live for instance.. because im in south africa we do not have a xbox live server in the whole of africa so we ping to europe.. so if we loose conection to xbox live we lag like no other as to where steam do have servers in our country. In the end me myself and i are done with console.

@GwapitoEmon,2024-07-11T21:58:45Z,0,"I came from console and shifted to PC recently. Basically I had already 2 PC. 1 is high end which is hooked on my 4k 120hz tv and 1 is at my bedroom at 1440p 120hz. 
All I can say is I need to tweek abit my pc at my 4k 120hz. But as far as the game goes, I could play almost all games at 4k 120hz compared to console. Some games at the consoles are not customised (some are still at 1080p 30fps). 
I am using an xbox series controller so I dont missed anything. 
Actually with this experience, I dont think I will ever come back playing consoles. 
It might be only the exclusivity of games, but you will never know, all games coming to PC anyway, its just a matter of time.

Anyway, I saw alot of noob comments here. It looks like they havent been using a gaming PC.

@Aisaaax,2024-04-04T19:59:12Z,0,"If you have enough money to build a really good (4070+) PC - it will give you better graphics. Buy a PS5 in addition for exclusives, if you want them. 
If you're on a budget, but you need productivity - still go with a pc.
And obviously if you are playing PC-exclusive games (WoW for example) - you should go with a pc. 
If you're on a budget but your tasks are games + web browsing and Office apps - get yourself a cheaper laptop and a PS5.

The reallity is that a PC that compares to PS5 in gaming performance - is like $1500 without peripheraps. It's 3x as expensive. PC actually usually needs to have better hardware than a console to achieve same fidelity and framerate because of how optimized games for consoles usually are. There is no reason to buy a mid-range PC because you are just throwing away money on your PC Master Race fetish that literally 3 other sweaty nerds care about in 2024.
And there's no reason to buy an x-box over PS5 because it is basically a weak PC with zero exclusives. If you are getting a console - at least get one with unique offerings.",Ko8ubyWDy58,True

A ps5 in Europe costs 599€ and then if you want the ps plus which is a must if you wanna play online… then that will set you about another 120+€ per year so you’re looking somewhere between 720€ to 800€ investing into a year of ps5 gaming without considering the higher cost of games on Sony or Xbox store… yeah Xbox series x costs about the same with its gamepass and whatever’s. So you’re paying a premium for worse gaming experience, no customization options, no graphical options but some presets given to you by the developer of certain games. No high fps options with very limited games that actually run at 120fps. Too expensive for what a console offers… and the whole PlayStation exclusives arguments are silly cause most of these games are ported to PC and run and look way better than on PlayStation. Certain ones that aren’t ported aren’t very great tbh as most their games are very little gameplay focused and mostly story driven over the shoulder action adventure games with light rpgs mechanics and a ton of cutscenes and woke agendas. A few exceptions would be Bloodborne, Demon Souls remake which are a must play if you’re souls fan.",Ko8ubyWDy58,True

I don't own a gaming laptop. My daughter owns one, and she doesn't need to drag a 50"" TV to another room to enjoy a game. This wasn't about battery life, this was about portability.

*_""You'll be looking for a new one as soon as the first game comes out that's not playable at your preferred settings""_*

Again, I don't own a gaming laptop. As for your comment; she owns a 13th generation core i7 laptop with an RTX 4070ti, no game will be too demanding for her any time soon at 1080p.

On top of that, she has a university agree, and works for the government, she can even afford a $20,000 gaming laptop if she wanted one, and still have enough money left to buy a car. 

*_""By the way, some games are better played on a screen big enough to actually see things happening, not on a laptop screen.""_*

Playing on a 50"" TV doesn't give you a higher resolution, and nobody gaming on such a TV is sitting close to it.

As a matter fact, the huge majority of professional gamers play with a  1080P resolution and something like a 24"" monitor.

Not only does this improve performance, and latency, the higher fps also allows them to use higher monitor refresh rates, which results in more accurate shots. The smaller physical size of the monitor also allows them to react quicker, since their eyes don't have to check a huge 50"" screen.

*_""Of course, maybe you still live in your mama's house""_*

@HighmageDerin,2024-03-17T09:16:55Z,1,"Pc has always been the best for multiple reasons. Not the least of which is when it comes to first person shooter and open world exploration style games the keyboard in mouse is by far the more superior input method. While platformers and fighting games are obviously dominated by controller. But a pc can use the controller. Not just the xbox one but also the playstation controller. In addition to a multitude of other control input purfields. If flightsim and space sim games are your cup of tea PC is almost your only choice especially a sane choice considering if you enjoy those games you're probably going to want an actual controller interface made for those games which means pc is your only port for them. Yes the PlayStation is had some throttle and stick controllers.  But you're pretty much limited to 2 very low dollar very low performance options.  Also p c's can be built from the ground up for gaming. And can do something that consoles cannot do called overclocking..... You can also run PC's on Linux apple, 5 different versions of windows. An a multitude of in-house proprietory operating systems that we don't even know the names of. Oh and let us not forget Chrome........ Steam has its own operating system for the steam deck which is essentially APC that you hold in your hand. And I love how PC's are supposed to be so hard for developers to make games for when there are more games for PC than every other console combined!   I guess for consoles the advantages you don't need to have a brain to plug it into the back of your TV and push the power button. Oh and did I forget you can also plug your pc into your TV............",Ko8ubyWDy58,True

@kacywatson6314,2024-02-29T23:14:18Z,2,"I’m unapologetically part of the console master race. 

Consoles are superior, they just are yes, I’m clearly aware of that consoles use PC components 

But all PS fives are identical so developing a game for the PS5 console is easier because all PS fives are the exactly the same, whereas developing games for PC is actually more difficult because you have to develop your game with more parameters in mind not to pieces are exactly the same Some pieces are built to make the games look good but run like crap and some PCs are built to run the game really well but look like crap. And some very expensive PCs can do both and you have to build your game to be optimised under all three of those conditions making the game harder to develop for four PCs ironically making the game on a PC but it’s not just a PC, you also have to make the game on a PC with a game development kit made precisely for PC Much like you would do for a console some consoles are the game development kit with themselves",Ko8ubyWDy58,True
@kacywatson6314,2024-02-29T23:33:37Z,0,"Okay, I’m actually gonna be a little bit realistic now. Neither of them is actually better. My comment above does say a few factual things but it is I obviously bias. Yes making games for console is easier because all consoles are pretty much the exact same but that doesn’t actually make development of the game any easier. It just means that you know the machine that you’re developing for with that said and out the way Let’s go on about how they are pretty much the exact same PC gaming and console gaming are kind of identical, but I will also explain why I still before gaming on console

And it all starts with Xbox Xbox are they’re partly famous because they’re consoles are using a lot of PC components and have been since the first Xbox and it’s had an impact on the development of all consoles to come because it’s made consul manufactures realise that using more powerful and cheaper PC components not only helps to make your consulate cheaper than the manufacture and easier to develop games for it. Also ultimately makes your consult slightly more powerful. Consistently Xbox have always been a little bit more powerful than their competitor. The PlayStation Not by much, however being as popular as it is proven that console gamers don’t care for raw power of the consul. I just needs to perform well enough it just has to be good enough and people will buy it. Sure some people plenty of people want some moderate power and performance from their consul, and that’s why PlayStation is more popular than Nintendo, but Nintendo also proves being more popular than Xbox. That console gamers don’t care for sheer performance and power and processing power, it’s nice to have and is great for PC game developers to work with and it makes porting console games to PC. It makes porting PC games to console easy and all games for most platforms are all equal fantastic or no worries you don’t want a consul that is complete shipped, but ultimately consul gamers do not care for she processing power, mainly because the people buying into consoles are not computer people. We simply want a simple machine that you can just play games out of the box and we don’t want to take her around the building our own custom machine. We just want to get out of the box plug it in plug it into the TV turn it on or look it plays games right away PC gaming is a completely different concept altogether from console gaming and neither one is better but they’re just entirely different console. Gaming is simple. It literally is your machine it’s dedicated to play games and play games. Only. I knew even how to think console gaming is simple PC gaming is complicated. It might be simple for you but for a lot of people who are not tech orientated they like myself don’t know a thing or two about building a PC and actually can’t learn how to do so and When it comes to pre-built PCs what are we going to do simply buy a gaming dedicate machine that just works or buy a pre-built PC that will probably be more expensive be liking and power and just not be grateful dedicated gaming unless you really fork out the money and it just happens to be Good playing games, but you just but you just spent a lot of money for a lot of processing power that is only going to be using like a small percentage of that processing power to play games whereas a simple console it’s probably as as powerful as you need it to be to play the games that are released, precisely for that machine so ultimately, since I actually have techno phobia I’m actually scared of PCs. I am not tech orientated at all. I ultimately prefer gaming on console even a good friend of mine who is tech oriented. I’ve computers and gadgets and stuff still ultimately before gaming on console, because a console offers a kind of gaming experience that a PC can never emulate, and I am going to take that saying to the grave by the way, because that’s what PC do they are emulation machines they never run natively on them. They need to run an emulation piece of software but that could be steam. By the way then run the game on the program and that’s called emulation. Consoles can do emulation as well that’s actually how backwards compatibility works, or at least that’s how backwards compatibility works now 

So yeah neither console or PC as better I prefer console because it’s the technology that I’m comfortable with since I have technophobia. Another friend of mine is really into his tech but he still prefers playing on console because he likes that separation of a different machine to do a different thing he Had a PC that was for Work and it was powerful to run games but he just didn’t like how this one machine does literally everything he doesn’t like it because humans are animals were monkeys and monkeys are weird, but another friend of mine she is not tech orientated similar to me and she just wants one machine that does everything and that is her PC so she prefers the game on PC. She does work on that PC. She plays games on that PC She browses the Internet on that PC and she has iPad precisely four her artwork and album art for her boyfriends band and not about it and a simple smart phone and on top of everything that I’ve just said PC gaming has kind of always just been a thing because that’s just how video games have started, but the idea of I dedicated machine that is designed precisely to play video games. That’s what consul is so if you are building like a gaming PC you’re not really building a computer you building your own custom game console because all game consoles effectively are dedicated gaming PCs and just to cut cost and artificially make them into their own product they they’re basically PCs, but with all the or most of the other PC functionality removed and everything that they need just to play games nothing else Ever as technology has progressed to today’s consoles are basically dedicated gaming pieces right out the box just not running windows unless you buy an Xbox it’s running on modified version of windows. You know you could just browse the Internet go on Bing and still go on Amazon and buy things you can go on Facebook and post something you can still go onto Windows XL or Microsoft Word on your goddamn Xbox through the Bing web browser are they Microsoft Edge. You can go into your Xbox and hook up mouse and keyboard. Operate the main system going to Microsoft edge in the browser and open up Microsoft Word from there and then write a CV. Write your résumé or something save it onto the OneDrive then go onto the web browser and start looking for work apply, and you don’t have to print out your résumé. As long as you play your websites. These days will allow you to upload your résumé or your CV Directly from OneDrive that you just made. Yeah your Xbox can do basic functionality so which one’s best the game on they are goddamn identical the only real differences the PC you can build the precise machine that you want which may or may not be more expensive and may or may not then have more technical issues because game development just has more variables to take to keep in mind naturally, so they might run into bugs and glitches more often, however, on a dedicated console since all boxes are basically all the same all PS fives are basically all the same that makes a little bit easier for game development because they know the system that they’re developing the game for it has one set of architecture so you’re less likely to run into bugs so ultimately gaming in general as better on console. However with that send gaming on PC is a completely other concept altogether which understandably other people may enjoy more for any other reason maybe gaming on PC offers you something obviously does offers you something that console can’t do as of yet and that’s most likely the idea of you building your own gaming machine which is effectively it is a gaming console. There is no real technical difference and both machines are basically capable of doing the exact same thing. Yep, and Xbox can do a spreadsheets",Ko8ubyWDy58,True

@iprodigy6723,2024-02-15T03:04:30Z,0,"Can you people that dont know what you're talking about stop making these comparison videos.
Its not as close as you believe it is, still a large gap. Some console games have pretty graphics and at basic stock settings might look comparable but performance is still significantly better on pc. Look at some of these RTX vids pc vs console counterparts, pc blows it away, im not big into rtx even tho i have an rtx card its not at where i would play with rtx on.
2) devs do not need to consider every different hardware out there for pc, there is way too many variables. This is why pc games have minimum specs and recommended specs.  Below min sure itll still play but probably not a great experience, people with above recommended specs will usually have a more comfortable experience and have advantages with some of the perks in the settings. Most new games the recommended specs are still in favor to those with cards from 2016-2017 GPUs and much older cpu's so thats false. Some new games recommend newer gpu's but not even needing the 40 series cards yet. So STOP with that propaganda its so misleading to those that dont know any better.
3) yes exclusives are leaving which is a good thing. More money for the corporations to continue to make good games. They cant convince everyone to buy their plastic boxes so lets just meet in the middle. Timed exclusives are bad as well. Too much time can pass before the next big game comes out people want. You risk losing sales. Microsoft has learned this, sony is always slow at certain business moves and waits to see how it works for someone else before they go oh were missing out we should do the same. 
4)ease of use is virtually the same anymore. Both need to be turned on. Ok consoles OS is different if you really want to set up thr pc to boot into steam big picture but clicking your game on the homescreen or click the steam icon really isnt difficult 😂.
First setting up a console youre downloading the updated necessary firmware which is essentially a driver, the constant updates, game updates, updating controllers. Its been months since i updated my gpu driver and havent updated my motherboard driver since i installed it or any other drivers. When windows asks to update i can put it off for as long as i want. Ill usually do it when im done using it. So yea there is zero absolutely zero valid argument when both pc and consoles have updates. The console pings you when ones avail then you when you have to, console updates also take much longer than a gpu driver does to download anyway. Ok continue...
5) you can literally disable the password to login off 😂😂😂
6) yes you do get a better gaming experiece on pc whether its graphics or performance. Consoles still getting fps caps of 30 when promised 60fps was going to be the standard is laughable and just taking it up the a** but this boils down to limitations back to the beginning of your video pc's can run a dedicated GPU or and APU which is what you should have said consoles have because they dont have a ""graphics chip"" they have a ln APU which the GPU and CPU shares data which is a major limitation. Boils down to lack of choices the multi billion dollar corporations say this is what youre stuck with and you will accept it and like it. PC has choices, different store fronts to choose from, cheaper games. The ability to choose the experience we want. 
7) price of entry yes pc is more expensive to get in but long term its cheaper. I built mine 8yrs ago for 1250.00 just bought a used 3070 last month for 300.00 im in it 1550.00 after taxes. 
Last 2 gen playstations up to current date including subscriptions and using the bare minimum subscription tier which most are using their middle tier but we'll just use the minimum and not including the many consumers who had to buy a replacement console due to failure, or mid gen refreshes and extra controllers  just between the last gen and current gen comsoles and bare min subscription to date is 1820.00 before taxes. That middle tier subscription most people use is more expensive youre over the $2k mark. So no  console gaming is not cheaper. We dont have generations, we dont have subscriptions, our hardware lasts longer, if a failure occures we can replace what part goes bad. If we need an upgrade due to outdated hardware that cant play new games we can replace just the gpu and that usually doesnt need to occur for many years. People that just play esport titles do not need super powerful PCs,  people that spend multi thousands on theirs are usually doing high task and high demanding stuff or workstations. The few gamers that do build those they want it to last 10+ years before having to upgrade. So yes a gpu can be expensive to upgrade or start a fresh build but current 4080 and 4090 will outlast this and next gen consoles argument invalid once again
9)yes pc has the best backwards compatibility because again NO GENERATIONS so in reality the best game preservation. 
10) people that get into pc gaming are not just people that want a better experience, they know its cheaper in the long run we dont need constant hardware upgrades or subscriptions, the hardware lasts longer lets face it the last 3 gen consoles have higher failure rates. A lot more and cheaper games, its an open market, we have choices, and freedom, game preservation, people play games longer look at gta v yea some people still play on consoles but whats making it constantly more fun on pc the modding community,  other multiplayer games the devs allow modded maps and people to run servers to host those maps, assetto corsa, some on pub g they had a death race map that was fun. You dont need extra crap to edit videos of gameplay to go from console to your pc or laptop to do all that. Do it all on one system.",Ko8ubyWDy58,True

@katieblackmore2004,2024-02-11T06:55:09Z,2,"As a 44 year old that has gamed since the age of 5, and only recently made the jump too PC... Yes..... By GOD yes PC gaming is better.
I was a console fan boy, i had all the revisions of all the consoles.
I blew money on the 360, PS3 fat, PS3 slim, PS3 Super slim, PS4, PS4 Pro, XB1, XB1S, XB1X, PS5, Series X......
I started too genuinely think, ''Console gaming isn't cheaper anymore''.
Then Sony all but confirmed the PS5 Pro.... and think about it, the PS5 and SX PROMISED native 4K gaming at 60 or 120fps.
They failed.... they failed so bad, that they are releasing a PS5 Pro, just so they can have a console that does 4K 60 as standard.
So all you console fan boys, you are already playing on consoles that do NOT do as they promised.

Now, for around £1,000 to £1,200..... You can buy a pre built ready out the box PC, by a company like Stormforce.
Out the box, the PC will look as good if not better than your PS5 or SX, you'll have more options too tweak, higher frame rates.
You WON'T have too pay money too game online.
You can still play Game Pass
You can still play your beloved Xbox games
You can still play your beloved PS games
You can use whatever controller you want
You have all the games on Steam

Also on PC you have the original STALKER, that with the current mods (free) make it look like a new game, you also have Ready or Not, 6 days in fallujah, WW3, Escape from Tarkov, Sons of the Forest.... There are loads of amazing games on Steam you can't get on PC.
Just look on Steam and go through the RPG's, Strategy, Adventure.... You'll see game after game that is PC exclusive.

As I've gotten older I got tired of having to deal with all these updates, troubleshooting, crashes, etc. I now prefer the simplicity of the consoles just due to the fact that I don't have to worry about tweaking anything anymore all you do is sit back, relax & enjoy a game. I simply don't have the time or energy to be dealing with these adderall popping teenager sweats that just defeat the purpose of gaming. Some days you just want to relax & enjoy a game but you run into Futive minions on every game lmao.

For example, you might start having performance issues with your game while playing or even an out right crash because windows decided to start updating and is prioritizing the update install over game performance.

Ill keep this simple for you. Roads dont have to be optimized for every single different car combination , with different engines, transmissions and tires.

You usually have to troubleshoot the chain of possibilities.  A console on the on other hand is a factory built unit.  Yeah rrod and ylod of course, but is that still a problem?  Is everyone sending back their xbox series X and PS5 cause it quit working?  It's potentially a matter of convenience.  Let alone you wouldn't feel as bad spending $500 on something vs $2000 if it quits working.  Also, there's no argument that consoles look better in the living room.

If you prefer open world games with high graphics demand and rpg style, I doubt for the same price there are any PC spec that would remotely come close to the Ps5 or series X/S.
If you are more on the casual side but still want some challenges, then the Xbox series X should be the best choice. Powerful, does have mouse and keyboard compatibility, is a great way to start play some triple A games while still had the ability to go competitive.
Ultimately, with no restrictions of money, I would honestly recommend the route of a Ps5 and a mid-range PC, one for competitive games, others for the Open-world, rpg or other types of game that isn't super competitive.",Ko8ubyWDy58,True

With PCS you usually end up running into the problem that you had to update a driver or something and now maybe the new graphics card driver doesn't like the update from the video game you're playing. Another problem is it's easier to mod on PC which is far more distracting and you'll go down the modding rabbit hole and you'll never play the game. Furthermore it's much easier to get distracted on PC because you want to check YouTube or maybe your email or you want to jump on the form where you don't have any of those issues with console gaming.

Great exclusives is not a flex. That is just them limiting the growth of their games to force people to either buy a console or wait. If they wait the hype is dead and the game wont sell as much as it would at launch.

World of warcraft is one the best PC games ever. Not talking the last few years but overall life time of the game. WoW is not on console. So its a PC exclusive.

@AaronWOfficial,2023-10-25T15:58:40Z,1,"If you are a competitive gamer, console is a huge NO. To play competitively you need 144fps or higher, or you will just get destroyed thanks to most games having crossplay with pc. If crossplay wasn't a thing, then that would be a different story

If you play single player games, or non competitive games (like co-op\mmo etc) then console does the job just fine. However pc has better mods, and you can make single player games so much better on PC. As an example, I can literally make skyrim look better than starfield with mods and still run at 60 fps or higher lol

PC wins on all fronts, but console is still very viable for single player gaming or co-op. More viable than it ever has been tbh. I am genuinely impressed from microsoft and sony this gen, they really knocked it out of the park with those consoles. Xbox series S needs to die tho, devs have complained about it limiting what they can do with their games because microsoft have a strict policy that any game for xbox must work on both consoles. Either they kill the S or microsoft needs to change their policy

Finally PC has a very distinct advantage if you ignore spec differences, which is basically the dealbreaker imo. If a game doesn't work you can get it working if you know your way around pc's by tweaking ini files or other such stuff. Whereas if a game is bad at launch on console, there is nothing you can do about it but wait for a patch because consoles are a closed system. This is why I will never buy console again, if a game doesn't work then there is no way for me to make it playable.",Ko8ubyWDy58,True

I also have every modern console and Sony just lost a customer, I know I have over 250 games in my PSN account, about 150 of those will be lost once I stop paying for PSN.  All of these games I have played and good memories on.  But the PS5 is almost 3 years (yes peeps, that is 3 years ago), and same goes for the Xbox and the Switch platform.  The PC I have built is about 3 times more expensive than the PS5 Disc version. So why then... Why spend so much more money?  Because I am not bound to one device.  If a game comes out on PS5, it might not always come out on Xbox or PC at the same time.  But, in deed, there are not many exclusives any longer.  PC is a solid middle ground.  My steam library goes anywhere with me.  Games are cheaper (Epic, Fanatical, and Steam sales).  With every 20 dollar discount, especially on early access, the gap gets smaller.  Plus, I get to choose the graphics performance, play at crazy high FPS, use a mouse and keyboard, yes, and controller.

@BerserkPublishing,2023-09-03T13:54:18Z,0,"Caveat, I'm a retired geek. I was PC gaming back in the 1980s while in college. I PC game now. That out of the way, there are a couple of things you glossed over, way over. First, stability. The early days of XBox aside, PC gaming rigs are extremely persnickety. If your dog or cat farts in the room your rig is in it is liable to crash your game. Those mods and tweaks you mentioned often cause game stability issues or can end with a virus being installed the gamer was unaware to check for. Additionally, PC games themselves often have memory leaks or prefer one graphics card over another, cough Intel cough, so the newest card on the block isn't even supported.

As to the hardware itself. Consoles are sold at a lost, which is why the games cost more. Sony and Microsoft get a cut of the sales, which helps offset the lost revenue on the console. Yes, you can pay more down the road, but you don't have to buy everything that comes out. Thus you can come out ahead if you are smart about it.

As for frame rates. The advantage of consoles is everyone is in the same boat. If your FPS is getting 40 fps, so are all the other players. On the PC a crappy player with ballin' hardware can pown an excellent player with cheaper hardware. That of course, sucks.

Finally, the overall cost. For the price of a graphics card you get a whole gaming machine, and lets be honest, Microsoft is pushing hard to make their XBox your next cheap home PC anyway. Even if you only game with it, an inexpensive laptop can handle your budgeting, writing, and web browsing needs. Heck, a mid tier laptop can handle your stream creation needs. Either way, you still come out ahead.

I'm not saying Console is better, but I am saying, if we are being honest, it's a tie. If eye candy on or under the desktop is worth dropping a thousand every year or two to keep up, then PC wins. Otherwise, um, well, the choice is yours, and your wallet's.",Ko8ubyWDy58,True

@Lunarwingluna,2023-08-25T00:29:04Z,4,"Been looking at a lot of discourse online, especially with some of the current releases, and this is sort of my entry to learning a bit more about PC and what it has to offer. From this video alone, it seems like my best bet is Xbox Series X (if they don't release a PS5 Pro which is rumored and not confirmed currently) simply because the price point of PCs are just insane by comparison even for the Xbox/PS5 equivalent. Even if the cost kind of irons out over time with the price of the monthly subscriptions and stuff like that, it's still either a HUGE upfront cost, or many, many months of collecting individual parts until you can finally put them together which could take who knows how long when graphics cards alone are so steep. Of course you don't need the best tech if you don't care about anything higher than 1080p 60fps (which is literally all I need. I don't even mind 30fps), but even $1000-1200 for entry level, midrange PCs is asking a lot depending on budget. If I am in a place where it's more afforadble, I would just buy everything, but the price value of console is always going to win out for a lot of people because of the economy. I still need to do more research, but the pricing of PCs might be enough to keep this a PlayStation versus Xbox conversation at the moment at least.

Absolutely not. It's better to have one machine that does it all. Not only is it more cost effective, it also means you have to focus on one technology only.

It’s hard to find unbiased help.  I just want a better experience than my old PS4 and maybe it can last 5 years or so.  I want to stream to YouTube and I’m currently using the native PS4 stream but I would like OBS.  What that means is I’ll need a computer regardless of which option.  Maybe running just OBS I can get away with something cheaper.

My choice?  I’d be on PS5 using a MacBook for OBS.  I just will never have thousands of dollars 😂    
     
Edit:  I play using a Wiimite & Nunchuk on my 55” TV.  That’s why platform doesn’t matter too much.  The Cronusmax+ facilitates the button remapping between DS4 & WIImote.  The TV has 120hz refresh rate.  To monitor my stream/chat I’d need another screen or maybe I can use an iPad?  I just went to look at PC Parts and HOLY SMOKES it must be the most option-rich industry out there hahaha

Absolute nonsense. As a matter of fact, in the early years it was far more difficult to get games running on PC. Secondly, nobody needs to know how to build a PC to own one. My son's previous PC was built by me, his current PC was built by a good friend, and guess what? He never needs me (and IT guy) to enjoy gaming on his PC.

Absolute nonsense again, only the one building it needs to do that.

*_""B option right now is around 3-5k$.""_*
Total nonsense..... TOTAL nonsense. How on earth do you manage to come up with so much nonsense? People don't need an expensive RTX 4090, or a Core i9-14900k and 128GB of RAM. Only people who like to game in 4K would need an RTX 4090. Guess what? Almost 60% of all Steam gamers play on 1080p, and guess what professional gamers prefer? 1080p!
You can easily built a PC for less than 2k, that can handle every game out there with easy, and I know, because my son's PC costs less than that, and yet he's running all games with crazy frame rates on ultra, he even has fast 7,000MB/s NVME drives and tons of RAM.

Tweaking settings? My guy u literally have a 7800x3d 7900xtx setup, what tweaking? It’s easy ultra on everything ffs. 

As for the price tag, well yh it’s worth as much as both consoles, but it also outperforms them combined, and there’s just so much more that u can do on PCs, my guy half of the PS library isn’t even accessible on PS5, u got emulation on PC for it and 99% of all consoles to ever exist, so the price not only reflects the performance, you’d have to be a clueless fool to complain about it for what u get, and don’t get me started on the biggest fish in the room, gaming is just one side of PCs, remote working, coding, browsing, editing, hell even crypto mining, and so many more, the amount of stuff u can do on PCs compared to consoles is incomparable, they’re called gaming consoles yet most medium range PCs outperform them in every metric at gaming alone, so again, complaining about the price of top of the line GPU that will carry u for the next 8 years in every digital endeavour in existence is plain moronic and irrational beyond belief, like no hard feelings but it sounds to me like u wasted ur money entirely if all u wanted out of ur PC was gaming and nothing more.",Ko8ubyWDy58,True

All PC gaming  machines are different, not just when it comes to performance, but also when it comes to features, quality, warranty, etc.

My daughter prefers gaming laptops, and never had serious issues with them (she has owned 3 so far), and I know, because is she never had any serious issues, because then she would most definitely ask for my help, considering I've been working in IT for about half my life. But then again, she doesn't by crap laptops like you do.

You claim that it was a high end gaming laptop is a joke, when you couldn't get 60fps on all games. It clearly wasn't all that ""high-end"" as you claim ha!
The quality of it was also not very great considering the issues you had, but maybe it was just your incompetence that caused all these issues.

> ""for serious gaming console is the place to be.""
You're a total joke. A lot of consoles aren't backwards compatible, so a lot of older games don't work. On a PC you can run even the oldest games without issues, heck a PC can even emulate consoles, and you can even use Linux for gaming. Don't even get me started by modding. When you buy a console game, you're basically stuck with what you get. This is not the case on PC. Not only can you make it run better, but also improve it with either mods or the editing of certain files. 

And once that PS5 is getting too slow, you;re fucked, while a PC gamer can just upgrade any component of choice. On top of that, consoles ares only useful for gaming, while a PC can literally be used for anything, heck even run a security system for your house, control your remote telescope, or connect MS Flight Simulator with a realistic Boeing 737 cockpit that you built yourself in your basement, if that's your thing. Look at this video ""737 Home Cockpit Simulator P3D v5.3 RTX 3090 i9 12900k TESTING THE SIM"" .... you can't do that with a console silly kid! 

Heck, people can even use a their PC to make games, to make mods, to make texture packs, create sound files, etc.  

You clearly know nothing about PC's... that's for sure, and it was right choice to play on consoles instead, they're made for clueless people like you hehe.",Ko8ubyWDy58,True

@luiscasillas9853,2023-06-22T12:26:21Z,0,"Well the obvious answer is that pc gaming is better for the following reasons. My reasons dont have to be your reasons. The immense amount of games available for PC. Pc is the genre with the most AAA exclusives then you get all of those other games that also come out for consoles but also on pc and not vice versa. Then you have the mods, the extra options for settings, the cloud gaming and cloud storage. Then you can upgrade your ram your memory your ssd your gpu cpu and so much more. 

But unfortunately not everyone can afford PC let alone an expensive pc gaming rig. Pc is any pc like desktop or laptop but gaming pc that gets expensive. We're talking above $3000 USD easily. As a matter of fact i think $3000 USD should be the basic budget for a gaming pc. Too of that you need to upgrade your graphics card roughly every 3 years along with your GPU also roughly every 3 years. That's another $2000 if you want medium high end to high end graphics card and gpu. Aside of that playing on a keyboard and mouse is more accurate in shooter games but its so complicated that i prefer a controller.

@chrisr1382,2023-06-21T20:39:48Z,1,"1:53 The claim that PCs can't fully utilize the hardware for gaming due to operating system ""overhead"" is absolute nonsense.  Those background processes and software DO NOT significantly affect PC game performance. If it's so difficult for Windows to fully utilize PC hardware (as you claim), then how is it that I can record my gameplay with Open Broadcaster Software (1080P, 60FPS, @40+ Mbps) with NO performance hit to whatever game I'm playing?   Bad PC ports have nothing to do with the PC platform or OS - it's due to lazy/incompetent developers - period.  You (and others) may think that gaming on PC is a relatively new thing or an added on feature, but you would be wrong.

Personal computers have ALWAYS been designed to include gaming as one of the features.  I'm old.  My first (real) computer was an Apple ][e back in the mid 1980s.  There are at least 1600 games for the Apple ][ computer.  It came with a joystick.  Go find pictures of old Atari 400/800 computers.  See the four connectors on the front?  Those were for game controllers (Atari joystick ports).  The Commodore series of computers also had Atari compatible joystick ports.  The IBM PC version was called a gameport and was built into many sound cards of the time (it was also a MIDI port).  The reason all of these PCs support game controllers is because they were DESIGNED for gaming as well as everything else.  The same applies to modern PCs.  

2:42 You have a channel called ""PC Centric"" so you should probably learn about how a PC actually works.  Game developers DO NOT have to code for different combinations of PC hardware.  Have you never heard of DirectX or graphics APIs?  Game devs need to choose a graphics API to use (DirectX, Vulkan, OpenGL) and decide which operating system the game will run on (most often it will be Windows).  They can certainly target CERTAIN GPUs for performance requirements, but the operating system and graphics API control the hardware.  You should know this already.  The ""console gaming is better"" proponents keep bringing up this argument and it's STUPID.",Ko8ubyWDy58,True

Been a console gamer most of my life since the late 1980s with the NES and Master system and getting into PC and building my own has changed my view on it.
1. I get more benefits on a PC that I build whereas on console I was stuck with whatever UI/chipset and games that plastic box.
2. Emulation . Yes PC has it and its a great way of archiving old games for future generations
3. Backwards compatibility. On console if I wanted to play an older game that wasn't on that particular plastic box, I would be forced to get the other plastic box as well as chuck out for the expensive carts/discs where on PC I can do that without having to go through all of that hassle.
4. Multiple displays off a single gpu/video card.
5. Upgradibility of hardware at the component level (I couldn't do that on a console)
6. Different choices in hardware configuration and form factor sizes for cases and motherboard
7. Free online (I had to chuck out money just to be able to access multiplayer on console on top of the expensive games on internet I already pay for)
8. Massive peripheral support of may devices and components (Use Series X, Dual Sense, Steam, Switch Pro and other controllers on my PC via bluetooth or USB wired connection along with keyboard and mouse and other peripherals... I couldn't do that on console)
9. Overclocking, I could do that if I wanted to but it would stress the hardware and lower its life
10. Cases (boy oh boy there are too many to count)
11. The modding of games (extends life of game and adds much more value and fun. Not to mention the graphical updates and other features that would make the game more interesting)
12. Multiple storage support in Raid 1 or Raid 0
13. Huge amount of software to use
14. Multitasking (couldn't do that on my time with console)

At the end of the day if you enjoy console then go on console and if you enjoy PC then enjoy pc, though remember that many PC gamers of today were former console gamers... Like me :)",Ko8ubyWDy58,True

@itsjusterthought7941,2023-06-19T04:34:15Z,0,"Before you can answer the question which is best, either PC Gaming or console gaming, you have to ask if the person is a gamer first. A hardcore gamer just wants to game. They love gaming. They do not want to waste time playing the IT geek trying to get things working or fine tune stuff to get the very best performance. If you say ""yes I am a gamer first and want to be doing my thing as soon as possible without any hindrance,"" then console is better. I have a computer science based university degree and have worked in the graphics industry, but I did not build a gaming PC. I bought a high end gaming console because I am a gamer first in my leisure time. I don't need to play IT geek.

Arguments about quality are becoming less relevant now as hardware technology converges and when efficiency is taken into consideration. The biggest issue facing PC gaming right now ever since PS5 released is data throughput. The graphical grunt of PC processors has started to become irrelevant in the face of data throughput. The latest GPU tech can work wonders with the data inside RAM, but if the game requires the RAM data to be replaced, the processors become starved.

The PS5 SSD and IO can stream game assets to RAM 2x faster than PC, which means there can be a huge amount of PC tflops going to waist in the form of idol cores and stuttering frame rates, due to the GPU waiting for data to arrive in RAM ready for the GPU to render the next frame. This has become apparent when trying to port PS5 games to PC. The devs are struggling to keep the PC processors fed so they can do their thing. Meanwhile the DF PC master race is claiming shader compilation stutters and idol cores as the culprit. A classic case of causality error. Not identifying the true cause.",Ko8ubyWDy58,True

@shawng4886,2023-06-18T23:43:59Z,10,"I was lucky enough to get a PS5 at launch. Been a console gamer all my life…

Honestly, what irritated me the most is both Sony and Microsoft NOT dropping development on older hardware. I dropped $500 on a PS5 and started feeling ripped for doing so… every damn game I had to choose between quality or performance and that got extremely frustrating.

So I bought a top spec pre-built PC(4090/13900KF) a few months ago and my PS5 has been collecting dust…

The only game I was honestly playing on my PS5 was Ghost of Tsushima…

Being able to play all my PC games on max settings is fucking awesome! I will say there is a definite learning curve to PC and finding out different things all the time… but the sheer performance difference compared to console is pretty crazy… seeing actual ray tracing in games is fucking amazing all while still playing at max settings and hitting 60-100fps in some games! Love this PC!

I will say though, the simplicity of console gaming will always stand out and be favored for me. Starting up the PS5 and being in a game and playing in seconds is amazing. Plus the UI difference!

With the various technologies that Nvidia has/is developing, my 4090 is typically running at 50-80% usage on most games. Nvidia is at the forefront of graphics technology. Hence why they’re dominating the GPU market.

Also, every game I play looks incredible on my 77” Sony A80J. You must’ve forgotten that modern TVs can double as gaming monitors. Simply enabling VRR on the HDMI port gives me 4K 120 on any game I want…",Ko8ubyWDy58,True
@AxleLotl,2023-06-18T22:29:11Z,1,"I think the biggest (And just about only) advantage of consoles is their simplicity.
You pretty much only buy a console to play games, which is what it does in practical perfection.
It's entirely up to the use case. The other advantage is price, although I would argue that consoles are the most expensive they've ever been whilst you can get some amazing deals on PC parts if you're savvy enough on where to look, what you need and how to assemble it. So the price to performance is just about as close as it's ever been in some scenarios.

I bought a Series S for the all-praised GamePass and while I did enjoy games like: Plague Tale Requiem (❤️), Jedi: Fallen Order or Yakuza most of the other games are just “okay”, fun for a few spare hours type of games, thinking about: Planet of Lana, Ori, Tunic, Death door, Guilty Gear
- Series S: great value machine, a lot cheaper than a good PC, for casual gamers very solid choice
- Series X: honestly I feel like either invest more and go PC or for the same price go PS5

The PS5 comes with all the fancy big titles, some like Horizon or Final Fantasy 7 even in PS Plus Extra, very powerful, sitting in the couch and playing on a nice TV is great with that thing

PCs are obviously the best of the three since you’re able to customize it, the GamePass offers even more games… heck no need for an XBox anyways here and the quality of games can look really amazing but all this comes with a heavy price tag, so I feel like you have to be really into gaming if you go PC",Ko8ubyWDy58,True

In my case I needed a PC for work so I built my PC 2 weeks ago. I've built PC before as well. Let me tell you, all these Youtubers make it seem like building PC is the best way, but it's not. It's quite hard. And things can go wrong, like plugging in wrong power supply cable r. Even after building a PC, it feels like that's all, but there's loads of things making sure right drivers are installed, making sure no error lights on motherboard. Even with right drivers there can be a ton of issues, like graphics coil whine for which the solutions are unclear. Better option is to just buy a ready-built PC unless you're confident. They also don't tell you most gaming PC don't include Wifi, mic, speakers, webcam no more than 1 ethernet port, sometimes don't come with thermal paste.

@vxsp1,2023-06-16T23:38:26Z,0,"As a pc enthusiast, I do say that he touches on some very strong points.  However, there are a couple things that he forgets to mention that are very crucial.  First, Xbox and Playstation do have access to internet browsers, meaning that they can access websites to do homework or any general task.  As well as this, some consoles do come with compatibility for keyboard and mouse (Aside from switch, which will force you to buy a 3rd-party adapter).  
Another topic that he didn't talk about was the used market.  Like many things, computer parts and consoles can be sold on the used market.  For example, somebody may be selling a ps4 for relatively cheap since they are upgrading to the newer generation.  Another example is that both entire computers and individual parts can be sold.  (NOTICE:  Please make sure that you buy from a reputable seller to ensure that you get the promised product.)
Last thing I want to mention is that computers are almost always insanely complex when it comes to the hardware.  Since there is a lot of variety, you need to know what to look for and what to buy.  If you don't, you could potentially obtain incompatible parts, such as an Intel processor paired with an AMD motherboard  (For compatibility, I recommend pcpartpicker.com).",Ko8ubyWDy58,True

@CosmicSquidly,2023-06-16T19:13:51Z,2,"I've had consoles ever since I got my Xbox 360 back in 2006. I've always enjoyed it and never really felt the need to get a PC that can do it too. Just a simple laptop that lets me enjoy media and get some work done was fine for me.

But once I got a job (as I was kid back in 2006) I decided to give PC gaming ago. So I bought myself an MSI GE63 8RF GTX 1070 laptop just as the 20 Series Nvidia cards were coming. I went for something that wasnt too expensive but was still good enough to play some current titles. I did enjoy it, not as much as I wanted too though as I'd justed moved house and my desk was a pain to get sorted properly. Once I did have it setup, it was faitly nice. But the fan noise and the heat it was producing was putting me off of it. So I mainly focused on my consoles again. 

But at the end of 2022 I decided to go all in on a gaming PC, a desktop this time as i've never had one. I've always had laptops for the past 15 years. I saved all my spare cash for the first 3 months of the year and got my parts in stages. I decided on a Ryzen 9 5950X (I wanted something that would be good for gaming but also be able to run virtual machines and more CPU intensive tasks), Asrock Phantom Gaming 7900 XTX, 64GB Corsair Dominator DDR4 3600MHz RAM, 1TB Crucial P3 NVMe SSD (Boot), 4TB Kingston Fury Renegade NVMe SSD (Games) and a 6TB HDD (Mass Storage). I went with AM4 because it was the better price otherwise I would have gone AM5, also with it being around longer, companies have had more chance to get BIOS issues sorted etc.

I did have issues with the first lot of Kingston RAM I had, but having switched to Corsair, I have yet to have any issues. 

I am absolutely loving this system so far and it was watching the likes of yourself, Jayztwocents and Linus etc that really set my mind on a building my first desktop gaming PC build.

Clearly graphics and performances are better but, there's no point unless you really care about graphics (even if difference are minimal at the moment) and most importantly performances (clearly 120 is better than 30 fps) or you are a tech head like me who enjoys following tech trends and learning about it as a hobby. I also have a Mac Studio for work and personal stuff, so... to me the PC really would be pointless if I wasn't a tech head, clearly the value standpoint is in console favor. To me the real plus is in emulation, I sold all the old consoles I had and now I can emulate games on one single machine and the goal is playing everything on PC (yep I can wait for those late Sony's PC ports but is early stages on PC for them, I see them releasing a Playstation Store PC Launcher in the future) so: emulation + multiplats + xbox and ps games = all on PC. Nintendo is out of the question I know, but I really only play NSW as a Zelda machine since I can't care less of Mario, Kirby etc... games, I'll find a way to play Zeldas every 6-7 years.

@SDW_Tech,2023-06-15T16:20:44Z,19,"In my opinion there's a not better side because they both had advantages and disadvantages for example, a good pc can cost a lot more than a console but you don't have any limitations to what you can do but on a console the only thing you can do is game and watch stuff. on a  pc however it will last you a lot longer than a console because you can upgrade your pc overtime but you have to see what components are compatible first (if you don't buy a prebuilt) and you don't have to worry about what's compatible on a console. plus depending on what you prefer and what your setup looks like you have all the possibility's to make a aesthetic looking pc or a pc that matches your setup theme, but you cant do that on a console, however like I mentioned before a console can be a lot cheaper than a good pc. so in conclusion if your on a tight budget and looking to spend £500 or so get a console if your mainly going to be gaming because a £500 pc is not gonna be better for gaming than a next gen console and if your looking to spend £800-900+ then get a pc.",Ko8ubyWDy58,True

@GiSWiG,2023-06-15T12:41:30Z,1,"I've been a PC gamer for over 35 years, semi-counting the years when I played King's Quest 1 on the family Tandy 1000 PC with an Intel 8088. Later I got my own Tandy 1000 RLX (from parents...for 'school'...) with a super fast 286 running at a whopping 12MHz, CRAZY FAST! I did have a NES and a Game Boy. I would not get another console until the original XBOX and mostly because it was practically a PC in a SFF case and pretty good for what it could do, but mostly for the modding. I still have my 20-year old XBOX with an original Xecuter X3 chip. I still play on a Halo edition XBOX w/ a Project Stellar modchip and XboxHD+ v2. It really hasn't been until the PS5 and XBOX series X that consoles have caught up to PC. Part of that, I blame NVIDIA mostly for releasing sub-par RTX 40-series cards at ridiculous prices. I can buy an XBOX Series X AND a PS5 for the price of a RTX 4080, maybe a 4070 Ti and for what? Console ports being broke, releasing with bugs on PC, with apologies from the publisher asking for a few weeks to fix while consoles are mostly fine? Quality Control now starts at launch day for PC with gamers actually paying for it! Consoles have more VRAM available to them and can push 10GB+ while ray tracing and some upscaling to match medium quality PC graphics at a good price. Have you seen anyone make a console killer PC video recently? XBOX One and PS4 level PCs could be built for about the same cost, playing the same games, costing less and without worry that your next PC can play those old games. Now, the GPU you need to match a current gen console (not Switch) needs a GPU with 12GB which you are already talking the a GPU the price of a PS5 and XBOX.

So you buy the latest console with the knowledge that in 4 / 5 years time you will still be playing with the same hardware and will have had no advancement in quality and no innovation.  The PC on the other hand is always evolving and the titles you play 5 years on from buying the PC are miles ahead of those you played at the start.  Of course there is a downside to this as well in that you may need to shell out on a new graphics card etc. to take full advantage, so the PC is still firmly in the realm of those that can afford it.  If you are one of those people however then the PC is the clear winner.  PC owners also usually have a games library massively larger than console players because of the mentioned steam sales etc.  when AAA titles just a few months old can be picked up for a song.

It still plays the games I want to play just fine. I am however thinking about what I have to replace it with (in 1 or 2 years?).

Replacing it with a second hand Ps5 would set me back €350 - 400. Building a PC would be more like €800 (or a lot more). And I have to factor in a monitor and mouse/keyboard if I want to use a desktop.

I'm leaning more towards a PC though, because I already have quite a lot of games on Steam. I also have a Steam Deck, so I would like to keep the ease of use of playing on either PC or Steam Deck.

On game prices, I think things are pretty comparable between console and PC. The prices on Steam are a lot cheaper than on PS5/Xbox. Certainly if you factor in grey market sites, such as gg.deals

The consoles, however both have subscription services that have great game selections for roughly the yearly price of 1.5 games.

And if you buy a console that can use physical media, buying second hand is also a great option to keep cost down. Games that are €75 on the online store can often be found for around €30 or less.

The portability of a laptop is a joke because u still need a desk to actually play something.

I own a gaming pc but only because i made a very high end pc 6 years ago and it provided me best value to just upgrade it with a new cpu and gpu than geting a console, but the drivers u have to keep up to date, errors, optimization, tweaks, is honestly quite fun killers and if u aint someone who knows what u doing u are fucked if some error pops up.

Optimization is the most resource-intensive task in making a game, that is if you want to make it run as good as it possibly can. 

 Back when dinosaurs walked the Earth, game devs optimized their games, because PCs were very expensive and PC hardware doubled in power every year, so your shiny top-of-the-line 1-year old PC was considered low tier the next year. So games had to be optimized as much as possible to make it run on any PC the buyer might have at home. Games like Starcraft could run on ANYTHING. Even Diablo 2 could run on a 400MHz Pentium II and be playable. That's insane.

 Imagine a recent AAA game running on a 10-year old PC - it should, if the devs even bothered to optimize it somewhat. But no, no chance in 2023. That's how lazy they've become. Games are even shipped half-finished nowadays, optimization is a myth at this point. If games were optmized in present day, they would've crossed the uncanny valley and look lifelike on current hardware. The hardware we have today is insanely more powerful than what we had 10, 20 or 30 years ago, but the graphics and performance to show for it are nowhere to be seen. Because devs are becoming more and more lazy by the year. And publishers are cutting more and more corners.

 For a console, devs only optimize a game to hit 30fps. If they can get it to 60 relatively easily, they'd do it. But pushing past that is pointless for them. Consoles can do better, but there are not enough people creating games that care to push them harder.

-Price: Console 500 + a monthly subscription for 7 years 10x12x7=840 + A common PC (still need a PC, right?) 500 = 1840 And not counting cheaper games on PC, let's say, you lost 5 to 20$ per game, let's say $10 per month? ok, another 840...

-Complexity: Another common myth... ok, you have a console, with all of its problems, and probably more consoles with all of their problems, which still less problems than a PC (if you don't know how to use windows). Ok, but wait! You still need a PC, right? At least a simple one, which has all problems of a PC-Gamer. So, still having all my problems, AND, all the problems of your consoles, so. I, with only 1 PC-Gamer, have at least 1 problem less than a console player.

My answer was to make PC gaming as close to a console experience as possible (SteamOS/HoloISO).

The main advantage of PC, for me, is emulation. As a result - ultimate backwards compatibility.

On my 4TB hard drive - Pong, Atari 2600, ZX Spectrum, Amstrad CPC, Amiga, SNES, PS1, Win98SE era PC games, OG XBox (with some PS2 + PC), X360, PS3, and Steam versions of X360, PS3, PS4, and Series X games.

Latest gen consoles literally have Ryzen CPUs, these are desktop parts, there is no excuse anymore they (MS/Sony and their devs) can think of to not support it. Other than what we are getting right now - devs just ignore it. If I could play Civ 6 and the like with KB/M on a console, there would be literally nothing keeping me stuck on my chair in front of the PC. 
 
 There is nothing like getting back from work, sinking in the couch in front of a giant TV and firing up some game to get your brain to function again. Laziness is a great seller for consoles, I bet :P It was for me, that's for sure. Yea, when I want to play ""seriously"" all day long on a weekend day, I'd use the PC, of course, but the simple ""let's go"" readiness of a console usually wins during the work week. The only thing missing is the keyboard. I ain't playin games that beg for a KB/M on a controller. Why nerf yourself when there is a better way ?",Ko8ubyWDy58,True
@TheSwayzeTrain,2023-06-14T20:17:37Z,1,"I genuinely think if you are a mid range or budget PC gamer, you may as well just swap to console. With how poorly optimized AAA games are these days on PC, and the astronomical prices of the latest GPUs, there just is not sufficient value there to justify PC gaming at those tiers. Essentially your experience will not be that different to playing on a PS5.

@blobeyeordie,2022-10-12T01:22:55Z,1,"The biggest advantages of PC are having an adjustable FOV(console needs this at least) and allowance of high framerates. With the framerates however, its not necessarily about how smooth and responsive high framerates make gameplay feel but rather how the game servers handle the greater or excess player data packets. The simplest way to put is that you essentially have 4x times the data being sent compared to consoles assuming you can hit stable high rates, basically allowing for a buffer that translates to you being ""ahead"" of other players. PC game servers used to have higher tick rates as well, which severely conflicted with consoles limited game server capabilities if crossplay was happening.

@metalvideos1961,2021-11-10T01:35:09Z,0,also FOV sliders are not implemented on consoles because it uses more GPU power. which the consoles simply dont have. maybe they can do it now with the newer consoles since the use the RDNA2 architecture from AMD. so they are pretty powerful. but yeah thats the main reason why console players dont have a FOV slider. also its is a pretty big hit on your CPU in general as well. and since older consoles didnt had a good enough CPU to handle it as well they didnt implement a FOV slider. now with the new consoles it should be more possible as well because their CPU is alot more powerful also.,uMBEvgiKqBs,True
@metalvideos1961,2021-11-10T01:32:19Z,7,120hz compare to 144hz is a major advantage though. 120fps doesnt help console players much if they are teamed up with a person who got a 144hz monitor and get a stable 144FPS or above. 120Hz is just a glorified 60FPS. it doesnt change much.,uMBEvgiKqBs,True

Try linear aim curve with Standard aim assist. it actually is challenging and makes the game work the way its suppost to. or atleast close to it. make it even more challenging turn ur FOV to max. Linear aim curve + standard aim assist and 120 fov i been playing on for a while. makes it feel like the older games. Aim assist when it works correctly trully mimics the workload of aiming on MnK but is even harder arguably. try those settings ule see what i mean.

Maybe you should consider these things before you comment, like a jackass.",uMBEvgiKqBs,True

@RockstarA69,2021-03-24T00:16:41Z,0,"i disliked the video for a few reasons.

1. you talk about advantages that PC player have and act like and aim assist is only good on pc but console players have also insane aim assist. 

2. You say the fps is alot better then on console. I play with a 1080ti on a 1440p on medium settings with 75fps and i‘m sure there are not a crazy amount uf people with a 2080 or higher to reach the fps that you talk about. Lets not talk about the 30 series grafikcards. You need a really good PC to get to this level of fps that  you talk about.

3. Wtf are you talkin about headsets? i played for years on console before i switched to PC after i could finally afford it and i always played with a headset. there are a lot of good headsets on the market from low to hgh prices and i cant remember someone of my friends playing on speakers. But most importang is: its not a benefit of a PC Player its a benefit of someone using a headset over someone that is not.

4. Here in Europe i get a Hacker once every 50. Game. You acting like you have one every second Game. xD

5. If you are on Playstation and dont want to play with 
„Hackers“  just turn off Crossplay. Done! (Didnt know that XBox players habe this issue so i‘m sorry for them bc they cant choose)

My conclusion on this video is: you want to gain some console subscribers by saying that its a lot better if you play on a pc and generate some sympathy to the console players and this for me is reason enough to unsbscribe.

@SultanOfSloths,2021-03-21T02:07:34Z,0,"I don't know if lowering your graphics settings could be called cheating... The large majority of PC players (>90%) are using very cheap computers that are likely to be less powerful than the Xbox series X or PS5, and sometimes playing on low details is all you can do to actually get over 40 frames per second, especially when Warzone runs like shit compared to other games. Not to mention that there are literally ten's of thousands of different hardware configurations under the umbrella of ""PC"", so having graphics settings are a necessity if you want players to have a playable experience, versus on console there are 2 hardware configurations for Xbox, 1 for PS5, meaning they can fine tune the detail settings rather than making the player figure it out for themselves. Honestly your examples of removing shadows and making bushes transparent seem more like a developer issue to me than players ""cheating"".

No it doesn't lol. What an unnecessary comment.

It’s literally like playing with a ball and chain attached to your ankles.

Also I feel There’s a huge difference between m&k and controller in terms of control and recoil, aim assist is really nothing when you have to worry about compensating each gun’s recoil in a controller. 

On m&k there’s virtually no recoil so it’s one less thing that you have to worry about when shooting and it’s makes a huge difference whereas on controller You have to worry about compensating vertically and horizontally depending on how the enemy is moving, plus everything else. 

And on top of that the aim assist sometimes interferes with your compensating on controller specially in hectic situations. 

I’d say it’s better to go from controller to m&k to really have an advantage.",uMBEvgiKqBs,True

@smagliaro,2021-03-15T20:03:35Z,0,"Can we all agree to stop blaming PC inherently and start expecting better parity between platforms from devs? Graphics controls, FoV support, etc. are all entirely possible on consoles. Devs explicitly choose to not put these controls on console versions because they think the ""general populous"" would be overwhelmed by it. Their excuse for not adding FoV in WZ is purely because they didn't want to decrease the graphical fidelity in exchange for wider FoV because wider is a bit more taxing on the hardware (they will not sacrifice 60fps either). The horrendous visibility in MW2019 and WZ has been a problem since launch that people have endlessly complained about, and PC's ""advantage"" for being able to use filters should not be an advantage at all. The game's visuals should have been designed better. The same goes for the Rose skin in particular. It shouldn't have been in the game in the first place. It has been getting abused for MONTHS with zero acknowledgement from IW.

As for cheating, this one falls on Activision's head and their seemingly absolute unwillingness to implement a real anti-cheat system and/or hardware and IP bans. Cheating sucks. No one on PC likes cheaters either. That said, the problem can be controlled much better than it is right now. Having full crossplay is objectively good for the community. Everyone can play together.

I know these problems are frustrating, and it's no fun to feel like you're playing at a disadvantage, but the ""just disable PC crossplay"" approach is such a smooth-brained solution. We should be expecting a better product, not blaming gamers.",uMBEvgiKqBs,True

I very much agree with your sentiment with regard to the FOV etc.  It should be brought to console and up to the player if they sacrifice performance.  New gen consoles will handle it methinks.

PC players have so much morn advantages then you even spoke about. The biggest in my opinion is that on a controller we are limeted to 4 fingers for making an input to the game. This stands out for example when you're trying to have a fist fight. The button for fisting and the stick for turning around ones own axis, both use the same thumb. So you can't turn yourself around and try to punch at the same time, which is a huge disadvantage when fighting PC players because they don't have that limitation.
Yes aim assist helps us a but to balance this but overall we have so many disadvantages to PC players that we only play with crossplay disabled.",uMBEvgiKqBs,True

@trev6783,2021-03-14T05:33:08Z,0,"I mean, if they just allowed a fov option(I don't think it's the big of a deal, but hey some do) on consoles and cracked down hard on hackers.. I think the lobbies should always be forced cross play.. I think this is what's made the game so successful, you have a larger concentration of players to get fast lobbies. The only argument to be made is the hackers, which is why its crucial for the success and future success of cross play that these companies take cheating far more serious. As for KB/M vs Controller, I think with the aim assist it's fairly balanced, it's just that you have more skilled KB/M players floating around than controller players and so newer players think it's a huge disadvantage, but truth be told there are some sweaty ass controller players out there too. I think the bigger advantage is that PC players tend to have more competitive setups(Monitors, headsets, etc), but it's a matter of choice and not specifically an advantage. I think they should just build ""nvidia filters"" into the game options, so that it's not an advantage to just one group of people.",uMBEvgiKqBs,True

That means I'm almost blind, maxed out graphics look good, but makes player models really hard to see. I realize I'm the exeption rather than the rule though.

Nvidia filters (I believe they were called freestyle) are Nvidia's take on Reshade, which was before called SweetFX. They were shaders meant to make a game look cleaner and better, but competitive players used them to overexpose the image. BTW, you can get something very close to Nvidia filters in any modern TV, you just have to mess a little with gamma/brightness and sharpness. Ideally in said TV's gaming mode.

And yeah, rotational aim assist shouldn't be there. It makes controller really OP in close quarter firefights, since they can strafe like madmen and still retain the aim lock.

@SpacedOut420,2021-03-14T11:45:19Z,1,"Recoil Control is easier at mid/long ranges on M&K. The sticks don't give you as much area to actually CONTROL the recoil. You can also make finer adjustments on M&K when it comes to aim. The Aim Assist is actually super annoying for /most/ console players. My team and I disable it when we play because it gives us a competitive disadvantage due to it actually being TOO magnetized, this is especially notable when fighting groups of enemies as the aim assist gets all weird and doesn't know which person to magnetize to, as far as CQB (Close-Quarters Combat) goes, usually I tend to get absolutely shat on by PC Players due to their ability to flick a LOT faster than we can. Vehicle Handling is definitely a no-go. The sticks don't help in the slightest. Then again, never been good with cars except for GTA V and even that is arguable lmfao. As far as flashbangs goes, the duration is the same on PC and console. The difference between a duration of the flashbang is how close it is to the intended target (this doesn't translate to stuns, the duration is the same. The only thing that changes for stuns is HOW stunned they are/strength of the stun depending on the distance between the stun and the target.",uMBEvgiKqBs,True

@MrZodiac011,2021-03-14T00:46:38Z,0,"The advantages are nowhere near as big as people think, I say as a PC player. I was a console user for most of my life, so I see both sides. FOV makes games feel less claustrophobic when you sit up close, not everyone sits on the couch, I sat at a desk a meter away from my screen with my PS4 and it looks disgusting. FPS only helps if you're already a good player. Not every PC user is cheating like console users think, an average PC player can lock on quite easily, it's painfully easy to make yourself look like an aimbotter, difference is a cheater will only get headshots, wallhacking exists, but there is no way to tell if they are.

I've been halfway considering getting a gaming notebook for months...but I'm not much of a gamer and I already have (and absolutely love) an m1 MacBook Pro. A gaming laptop would be purely used as a toy haha. But I got a cool new job that pays pretty well a couple of months ago so decided to take the plunge. I was afraid I'd regret not spending more (significantly more) and going with a 4090...but no, everything I've thrown at the 4080 so far as been amazing...all with maxed out graphics/video options.
I just loaded up Assassin's Creed Origins yesterday onto the machine and I'm in absolute gaming bliss! I know it's not the greatest game out there, but omg I sunk SO many hours into that game through my Series S a couple of years ago and a huge part of the love I had for the game was the graphics...they completely blew me away on the xbox. I tried playing it at lower graphics settings on my Steam Deck and the game just wasn't the same. I wasn't able to get into it. But with my 4080, I have every single graphics option maxed out...and yeah, like I said, I'm in gaming bliss!

Much better) but I  am blown away by how good it looks and runs with it all maxed out. With DLSS 3 and Frame Generation, compared to my RTX 3080 Ti 12gb (great card but is about half the frames in this game). 

I had my nephews plug in their PS5 and Xbox series X with both monitors and while it is impressive they can even run this game, with the new features incorporated in graphics and gameplay and having a 4080 that doesn't dip below 2970mhz path tracing or just ray tracing on high or Ultra at 4k or even 1440p with DLSS 3 and Frame Generation is unreal. The feels over stutterless 120-200fps is crazy. 

What is more crazy, is the fact they attempted to release this game on PS4 and Xbox 360. Such a waste of human resources and could have released the game in such a better state. 

With my nephews plugging in their respective controllers, its cool to see how impressed/immersed they were. Has since given them an interest in learning about how to properly build a PC. In the end you can save a lot of money from not having to buy any where near as many games. 

Would be nice if Cyberpunk did have a mode where you could host your own server with a few buddies though. Even if just to play some side quest missions coop style, or just be in the city doing own thing. Very happy these guys have incorporated new technology to make it run soooo much better than when it was released and make the upgrade to a well cooled RTX 4080 worth it .. just for this game.
