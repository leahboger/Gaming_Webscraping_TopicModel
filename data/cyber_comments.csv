kq2ltb1,"2500 - 3000 is crazy i dont think you need something that expensive

currently play on xbox series x, the optimization isnt amazing, its not constant 60 in more crowded areas like dogtown and NC and even some areas in the badlands it dips below. The game still looks great and is playable, however it can kinda damper the experience, esp if you're running around with dash jumping it gets to probably 40+minimum",None,2,2024-02-12 12:09:05,t3_1aoy1ml,1aoy1ml,PC vs. Console
kq2op43,"If you're a pc person, pc will be always the choice. Same if you're a console gamer. Surely console are cheaper for the quality provided but you sure don't need 3000€ rig to have good performance. I'm playing on a Ideapad gaming3 with a GForce 3060 (900€ 3 years ago) and I manage to have a stable 60fps with good graphic quality. Plus, I've a dualboot with linux that give me everything else for my non-gaming needs. To me that's perfect. Of course cyberpunk as a masterpiece that it is should be run on some badass rig but, at least for me, su much money for gaming is not worth it.",Tri_fester,2,2024-02-12 12:37:02,t3_1aoy1ml,1aoy1ml,PC vs. Console

I'd say your bottle neck is the gpu atm, if I had to upgrade anything that's what I would look at. I upgraded on the tail end of the pandemic price hike, should be much more affordable to get something decent these days.

Edit: also, get a good ssd if you don't have one already. Cheap but very effective.",EinFahrrad,2,2024-02-12 12:40:37,t3_1aoy1ml,1aoy1ml,PC vs. Console
kq32hm1,"Best plan at this point — buy a console simply because It's cheaper and immediately start collecting money on PC. Let it take as long as it'll take, you will at least have a decent gaming machine until it's too late (if you only plan to hop on console — second half of generation is usually a worse idea than hopping at the beginning when it actually can compete even with high-end PCs sometimes). But I can say currentgen is still growing (there's still kinda a few real nextgen games and I believe there's still some surprises left to arrive) and isn't completely finished from potential perspective.

So better sooner than late.

Thus, you'll eventually have something to run games while you're building up your PC. And once there's 200-400 bucks left until final piece of hardware - you can sell a console and finish the building process by buying last thing for these money. Even if market price for console will drop, 50-100bucks for another year of affordable yet decent gaming experience is more than worthy.

If you're wondering how ""bad"" games on console and 2077 in particular are — I can say all runs smoothly with pretty decent level of graphics and only several games either don't have or have very poor performance modes, so 60+FPS experience at okay visuals is granted unless it's BC-games on PS (many eventually got BC-patches).

kq67zw1,You clearly don't actually want a console you just want to play Cyberpunk sooner rather than later but once you're done playing Cyberpunk you'll have a box you don't actually have any use for so you'll need to start saving for a new PC.

kq2oyap,"More a question of priorities. I plan to buy one or the other towards fall 2024 so it’s really a matter of how much do I need to save up until then and do I need to get monthly payments for the rest of the amount I will need. 

If my calculations are correct it’s 1000€ difference when I include controllers / games on the console side vs. Just the new pc (I already have keyboard, mouse and most games I currently play on pc). 

I don’t want this to be a reason for problems in the long term.

The wife also prefers a console because that frees up space in my room which we could use otherwise. 

One thing I can not factor in is how playing with my friends will impact the overall package since most of them play console games that I don’t really care about on pc. 

I’m usually playing war thunder and eve online while they play arc, gta, warzone and so on. Switching to console would probably make me switch to those games as well but I won’t always play online and cyberpunk is the game that I fancy the most so I want a good experience there when playing alone.",RayBln,1,2024-02-12 12:39:24,t1_kq2lzu8,1aoy1ml,PC vs. Console
kq2o2pv,"Well if I do this I want to do it right. The only reason my current pc lasted this long is because I dropped 2500€ back in 2015 which gave me a pretty powerful pc for the time (i7, 32gb ram, gtx980 ti). 

My logic: if I do it again I should have another 9 years of joyful gaming without headaches. 

What you described regarding the fps is precisely what I do not want to have (I’m weird like that) plus there is not only cyberpunk I want to play. 

Pros for a console imo would be that most of my friends have them and I could play with them. 

I just really fear the anger I could feel having performance/ fps issues and regretting not investing the console money towards a new battle machine.",RayBln,1,2024-02-12 12:31:10,t1_kq2ltb1,1aoy1ml,PC vs. Console
kq2ra3a,I see where you are coming from and also thought about this.

kq7k248,"I admit I’m biased because I honestly think a pc is better. What I’m trying to figure out is if it’s worth the investment. I’m not someone who can play 4-5 hours a day anymore, more like 1,5 if I’m lucky. 

Also I don’t really follow the aaa titles anymore as they don’t catch my attention that much.  

Don’t know if that’s just a phase or if that is going to be permanent so maybe it’s time to switch sides and become a console gamer. 500-700€ every other generation sounds a whole lot more efficient that what I’d want to spend on a pc.

kq2t2h2,"> a medium spec one but those were outdated after 2-3 years

That is surely a good point but everyone must come to term with its own economic possibilities. A desktop pc will give you the flexibility to upgrade over time, while a console will give you directly high-end result but with other downsides (like the money for a tv, no other use as for gaming, and no upgrade possibilities).

l5h1y68,"Have you thought of GeForce Now and a console?

GeForce Now is great if you have good internet. I'm doing that. For games like cyberpunk where the PC hardware is really used to make a difference, I can pay $20 a month and get access to an rtx 4080 PC. For the vast majority of games I can play on console and get a good enough experience that is tinker free and works every time I turn the console on (my PC experience this wasn't guaranteed).

But even GeForce Now all the time is $200 a year and they will upgrade once the 50 series comes out. In 5 years that is only $1k.

kc95wrk,"mods and graphics. A lot of what went into the new update are things that had already been accomplished through mods, they just added in officially because they can do it better than modders and because the console players didnt have access to it.

As far as graphics, you owe it to yourself to watch someone display 2077 fully maxed out, the tech used is pretty much experimental in some cases, and 2077 is the first game to have ever used it. Specifically the ""path tracing"" in addition to the ray tracing, and something called ""DLSS ray reconstruction"". It only takes a quick google search to learn what these do. 

maxed out 2077 is imo the best looking game to have ever been made.

* a powerful PC is obviously going to be better graphics wise
* PS5 has the Dualsense controller and Cyberpunk did an incredible job really utilizing the vibrations, and adaptive triggers, it's a whole different level

And then there is another factor: fun factor

I used to game on PC as a kid so my info is probably quite oudated, but I liked gaming on PC for precision stuff: Sims, rollercoaster tycoon, shooters, strategy like Red Alert

But for everything else I like console. I like the idea of sitting down on my sofa on my huge TV and playing and relaxing and not being on a computer where I work. It gives me a different space to be in.

My computer screen is a nice 4k monitor I think 27 inch and my TV is a nice LG C3 55 OLED so that also makes a diff for me.

I really do wish they made consoles upgradeable though (like through an official upgrade certified retailer) to give business to brick and mortar, to also be less wasteful, if there is a money incentive/discount in there even better but unfortunately this isn't a thing.

But the input lag killed me. After 3 hours I just couldn’t continue so I switched to Performance. All was well until I reached Tom’s Diner where FPS started taking a hit and my game hitching. Then memory is loaded and leaked. They have serious issues with the engine. I encountered same with RT also on PC, so I ultimately chose to go on PC with RT local shadows just as on PS5 with flawless 60 FPS and avoiding loading the VRAM.

I said it many times. Game is gorgeous, art direction out of this world. But the engine is flawed. And it’s been more than a year now and they simply cannot fix this memory leak issue. In fact, another issue with loading the map was discovered.

hzkuszl,"> I don’t understand why people play on pc

Well, I've been playing mostly exclusively on PC since the early 90's. I also enjoy working on and upgrading my PC as a hobby. For me, there are just overall far more pros than cons when playing games on PC over console in general.

It's all preference, but I would take 1440p 100+ fps minus RT but with all the other settings higher over what the consoles give in CP2077 (I could turn on RT, but in my opinion the performance hit isn't close to worth the RT visuals). I also am able to freely choose if I want to use KB/M or Controller depending on the game, at times using both in some games.

That's also not getting into being able to use Mods, which are big in CP2077. Beyond that, I can still get the console experience by hooking a PC up to my TV (my 2nd and 3rd PC's are actually connected to my TV's, although one is for media and the other is for media/gaming).",VelcroSnake,3,2022-03-06 14:34:03,t3_t7z0br,t7z0br,Why does mostly everyone play on PC?

k26r9a6,"In world navigation. I started 2.0 with a new save on Xbox and I was tripping thinking this was a feature from the game and being baffled it wasn't working. It took a bit to remember this was a mod from PC lol

There a mod to fix your perspective. It raises the camera to eye level, and makes it so you can look down and see your whole body, I cant remember what its called but Im pretty sure I remember having a fix for this. I was in the car with Dex when that mod being gone hit me. I was like wtf why am I so short?

The mod for radio everywhere is crucial for me, I love the music and the amount of times I've drove past something just to roll around the block while vibing to some music now is pretty wild. ""Oh shit somethings going down in Haywood,"" **cruises by looking intensely out the window with my head bopping, thinking they better be gone when this song is done**

Missing persons. It's huge, and I really wish this would've been added in 2.0, its already there, it just needed some TLC, and it just adds so much.

Cyberarms. This is a feature I'd really like to see added in the base game, I know it's just cosmetic, but we need more cosmetic cyberwear, the whole thing. Style over substance.

Speaking of all this now, there's something I really hope gets added into cyberpunk 2, even though modders have worked on it for CP2077, is a 3rd person camera. It could easily be explained in the world through ""optic modes"" or something in cyberwear. A little drone that follows you, to give you 3rd person vision. I know it was a design choice by CDPR, but I really think they need to give players that choice and it's already explainable in the world in a way that's never really been able to be justified like it could in Cyberpunk. It's just too big of a feature that ties into the cosmetics and CP2077 really calls for it with ""style over substance."" I want to see my V interact with the world sometimes, I'm a player that likes switching between the two based on how I'm feeling.",Scooter_S_Dandy,1,2023-09-25 20:27:29,t3_16ruxjg,16ruxjg,"PC players: what is one mod you can't live without, and wish console players could use to?"

So if theres an ability I dislike, such as Focus Mode, I can still pick Deadeye in the next tier of Cool without having to get it.   


The other thing would be, a mod to turn off certain sounds.

k25rvoo,"Depends on the mod, but in general it's very easy. Go to nexusmods.com and install Vortex, and then in the games find cyberpunk and activate it. It should download the necessary extension for the game. Then look for the mods you want, and install using the vortex option. This won't always work for every mod, some do require a lot more effort to use, but I find that the vast majority of the ones you would want to use the most can be installed and used with Vortex, which manages the mods. Then it's just a matter of checking them for updates via the mod manager (vortex has a button for it) and then updating.

This won't prevent them from breaking the game, and it can be challenging to figure out which one is the culprit if you don't know how to check the logs, but honestly if you don't go absolutely crazy and install hundreds of mods, you should be fine. I also find the online community in the discord server and even on here to be incredibly helpful.

The Metro is one of the most immersive things you can experience and it's crazy how much of the city was designed to be viewed from that perspective. But I get it, most players don't even drive and opt to fast travel over all, and it is just a video game at the end of the day. 

But IMO, nothing beats exiting V's apartment and slowly walking in a 3rd person view that highlights your style(cyber aesthetics included) while you make your way over to the RCart station.
